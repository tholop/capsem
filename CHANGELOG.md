## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `capsem run --image IMAGE --network NAME` joins the container's VM to a named
  network at creation, like `capsem create --network`.
- Members of a network have names: `<vm>.<network>.capsem.internal` (and
  `<vm>.capsem.internal` when only one network answers it) resolves to the
  member's address on that network, and the address resolves back, for
  members of a shared network only. The zone is answered on the host with no TTL and never
  forwarded upstream; a member that leaves loses its name at once.
- Every network is a switch, and every membership a cable. Each network has
  its own subnet (a `/24` from `10.128.0.0/9`) and one confined
  `capsem-router --network` process: an ordinary layer-2 switch with no uplink.
  Joining leases the VM an address in the subnet and plugs one cable, a
  `cable<N>` tap in the guest declared at 10 Gb/s full duplex; a VM on several
  networks has one cable and one address on each. TCP, UDP, ICMP and ARP
  between members all cross that one switch, end to end between the guest
  kernels. Broadcasts flood with a per-port storm cap, unknown destinations are
  dropped, and port security drops any frame whose MAC, IPv4 source or ARP
  sender is not its port's. A VM on two networks never forwards between them.
  A VM's profile decides once per plug (`network.protocol == "link"`), and
  `capsem network logs` shows each plug and close, a close with the cable's
  frame, byte and drop counters; `capsem network inspect` shows each member's
  address and state.
- Named networks: `capsem network list|create|inspect|delete|connect|disconnect`
  and `capsem create --network NAME` group VMs that may reach each other on
  their private addresses, over `/networks` routes on the service and gateway.
- `capsem network logs NAME [-f]` and `GET /networks/{id}/logs` page a network's
  audit history with a cursor and VM, connection, type, decision and time filters.
- Every VM starts unplugged; the agent runs one `capsem-tun` pump per plugged
  cable and restarts it if it dies. The guest kernel and `capsem-init` size the
  network stack for 10 Gb/s cables.
- Deleting a VM retires any network it leaves empty; disconnecting does not. A
  retired network's audit database is kept 30 days and then removed by the
  service at startup or on the next retirement.
- `capsem-bench-rs throughput` measures bulk upload, download, bidirectional
  transfer and echo latency over N streams, and serves as the far end itself.
- The logger supports bounded primary transport audit records, with indexed
  connection/network identities and an additive upgrade for retained sessions
  that preserves the shared session index's schema version.
- Security rules recognize typed `network` routing facts. Network boundary
  events validate owner identities and require an explicit allow; retained
  security ledgers accept their new event types through a checked migration.
- `capsem-bench-rs redis` collects validated Redis PING samples with configurable
  concurrency and pipelining on both the host and guest.
- `capsem run|create --image IMAGE -p HOST:GUEST` publishes loopback TCP ports through VSOCK
  using a confined Rust companion, with bounded concurrent connections and
  listener cleanup when the workload or VM exits.
- `--image docker://IMAGE` (or a qualified registry reference) pulls and caches
  verified OCI images and runs the image's command as the VM's workload.
  `capsem create --image` starts it detached, with its output in `capsem logs`,
  and keeps the VM only when it is named with `-n`; `capsem run --image` streams
  it, exits with its status and destroys the VM however the run ends. A command
  after the image replaces its default command. Registry-specific CA trust and
  username/token authentication are supported.
- Containers started with `--image` reach the internet through
  the VM's existing DNS and HTTP(S) interception: the same rules, plugins, and
  ledger apply, the container trusts the Capsem CA read-only, and it can reach
  nothing else inside the VM.
- Both profiles include `runc`; guest kernels support offline OCI process
  namespaces and cgroup CPU, memory, and process limits.
- Both profiles include `umoci` for OCI image layer unpacking inside the VM.

### Security

- rustls moves to 0.23.45 for RUSTSEC-2026-0285: TLS 1.3 handshake messages
  were accepted across encryption level boundaries on the host's TLS paths.

### Changed

- Security rule and decision ledgers are read from disk instead of being
  mirrored into memory, so opening a large `session.db` no longer freezes
  service startup for minutes or holds the whole forensic history in RAM.
- Published TCP connections require an audited allow from the existing security
  rules and plugins before guest setup. Profile defaults explicitly allow expose;
  deny, pending approval, audit failure, and stale control leases refuse access.
  Transport records include trusted VM, listener, peer, and connection identities.

- Active profiles can configure router connection and setup budgets under
  `network.router.expose`, within fixed resource ceilings shared by a VM's ports.
- Published connections carry the VM owner's boot generation so stale streams
  cannot consume reused request IDs after restart.
- Container port forwarding uses fixed kernel socket queues, including guest
  VSOCK credit limits, to propagate backpressure from stalled peers.
- Guest published connections are canceled and joined on control disconnect,
  shutdown, and snapshot preparation; namespace setup uses bounded workers.
- Guest VSOCK connection attempts now use a finite setup deadline, including
  published-port connections whose host stops responding during setup.
- Published ports share VM-wide connection and guest setup budgets, with bounded
  setup pacing across listeners.
- VM shutdown joins published-port brokers and guest handshake readers before
  draining session logs; publication removal requests cooperative cleanup.
- Container port forwarding closes stalled writes and half-closed peers after
  60 seconds while preserving quiet connections and trailing response bytes.
  A half-close on a published connection is carried as a signal:
  a slow reply after the client stops sending, and an upload after the peer
  stops sending, both arrive in full.
- Published TCP listeners stay with the VM owner. The confined router receives
  only connected descriptor pairs; bounded acknowledgements and control failure
  close both endpoints even when the router retains duplicate descriptors.
- The confined network companion is now named `capsem-router`; package signing
  continues to exclude virtualization authority.
- Shell runs flush captured output before exiting, preserving short output
  without a trailing newline.
- Port publication reports sandbox initialization failures explicitly. macOS
  gate tests hand off the named router to its own stricter sandbox.
- Local focused tests preserve the invoking checkout's assembled VM assets
  instead of replacing them with another branch's cached kernel or rootfs.

- Container runs now retain their named VM for the existing stop, restart, fork
  and delete commands. Closing the log client detaches; reboot restores the
  saved image command and host port bindings. Forks omit host bindings.
- Host builds and native packages include the port router; it receives no
  virtualization entitlement.
- Registry pulls use the existing WebPKI TLS trust stack without platform
  keychain verification dependencies.
- Single-architecture asset builds and initrd repacks generate manifests for
  the selected architecture, preserving incomplete builds for other targets.
- Release rehearsal reads Debian package identity, embedded manifest metadata,
  and inventoried binaries portably on macOS without host extraction tools.
- Docker cache inventory accepts local timezone labels such as EDT while using
  the timestamp's numeric offset for retention decisions.
- Debian platform checks run on macOS without host Debian tools or shared
  temporary directories, while exercising the exact packaged executable.
- Cargo cache maintenance reclaims old incremental compiler state under native
  build locks while preserving compiled dependencies and signed executables.
- Guest control connections survive reconnects when no snapshot froze the
  filesystem; real suspend/resume still requires successful freeze and thaw.
- Local profile assets and OBOM files decode file URLs correctly, including
  spaces and escaped filename characters in macOS shared directories.
- Asset repair reports profiles as not ready until background reconciliation
  publishes the refreshed status, avoiding contradictory readiness responses.
- Tart install proofs stage the release helpers' Python dependencies, so the
  clean macOS guest can serve manifests and verify installed transitions.
- Local macOS packages consume executables from Cargo's canonical output
  directory, fixing package assembly after a successful release build.
- Focused install verification produces the complete profile asset cohort and
  checks every architecture before spending time on release package builds.
- Cross-architecture asset prefetch includes each target's certificate-source
  image, preventing sealed builds from unexpectedly contacting the registry.
- macOS nextest launches close accidentally inherited pipe descriptors before
  test entry, preserving detection of subprocesses leaked by the tests themselves.
- macOS Cargo executions use verified signed clones, preserving warm reuse while
  concurrent builds replace their original executables, including temporary
  missing-file windows during replacement.
- Focused macOS binary verification builds its runtime executables before signing,
  so it works without a previous full build.
- macOS test runners reuse verified signatures for unchanged binaries, avoiding
  repeated signing and lock contention for every nextest case.
- Rust coverage ratchets account for macOS's compiled code inventory while
  preserving the shared minimums and Linux floors.
- Temporary build outputs cannot publish into the shared component cache;
  guest cache reuse rejects placeholder or non-executable binaries and rebuilds them.
  Linked worktrees publish and reuse guest binaries staged in their own cache
  tree instead of recompiling every guest agent on each gate run.- Install smoke tests use their configured writable pytest cache, allowing
  qualification to finish while the source directory remains protected.
- Sealed install smoke checks retain tool stdout and stderr in gate evidence
  so failed qualification identifies the missing or broken input.
- Docker builders retain installed dependency layers when only their identity
  labels change, and host tool version changes preserve earlier install layers.
- macOS source watching ignores delayed notifications for unchanged inputs
  while retaining detection of live writes and permission changes.
- Benchmark preflight recognizes macOS without requiring Linux's KVM device
  and records native system load on both platforms.
- Tart cache enforcement counts tags and digests sharing one cached image once,
  preserving warm macOS release bases without falsely exceeding their budget.
- macOS development gates can start the shared compiler cache inside the
  network sandbox, and private Git snapshots exclude unreachable build debris.
- Web dependencies include the latest Astro, Sharp, Vitest, js-yaml, and SVGO
  security fixes, with downgrade guards across all four web workspaces.
- Linux automatic upgrades preserve the updater's manifest handoff when
  replacing packages from `capsem-update.service`, avoiding a premature fetch
  of the previous public release during installation.
- Benchmark recordings retain guest error counts and concurrency metadata;
  HTTP error responses count as failed MITM load requests.
- Multiplexed guest DNS remains compatible with older hosts: replies without
  correlation IDs require an unambiguous match to the original DNS question.
- Worktree test gates preserve the shared cache authority across re-execution,
  so guest tests launch the host binaries they just built.
  Copied source timestamps also invalidate stale Cargo fingerprints from other
  worktrees instead of reusing binaries for different source contents.
  Gate runs no longer touch every Rust source when they take the machine lock,
  so an unedited checkout stops rebuilding the whole workspace on each Cargo
  invocation; the checkout-keyed workspace wrapper already keeps a build that
  finishes while another checkout queues from supplying that checkout's binary.
- Failed or interrupted complete local tests now block automatic full reruns;
  retries require an explicitly approved reason, while focused checks and
  self-qualifying release commands remain available.
- Shared Cargo caches isolate workspace outputs by checkout, preventing an older
  release snapshot from silently reusing another worktree's compiled code while
  retaining warm third-party dependencies and exact-checkout reuse.
- Resuming a persistent VM protects its socket and session state from delayed
  cleanup of the previous process, preventing intermittent execution failures
  while still reporting crashed restores immediately.
- Linux VM-device rules prevent transient permission loss on VM create and
  destroy, including for services with stale supplementary group membership.
- Failed test gates retain pytest diagnostics when collecting workspace logs,
  instead of erasing the original failure evidence during teardown.
- Service startup prewarms only profile-requested overlay sizes, eliminating
  an unused 16 GiB sparse template from the installation cache footprint while
  preserving warm reuse of the configured VM disks.
- Cache enforcement failures retain the live native-resource breakdown before
  test containers are torn down, without hiding the original limit violation.
  Failed installation proofs also retain allocated and logical directory sizes
  from the container before its writable layer is removed.
- The code and co-work profiles advance independently to 0.6.2, carrying the
  guest reliability and benchmark improvements accompanying binary 0.6.3.
- Capsem advances to version 0.6.3 for the cache-control, test-performance,
  runtime, and security fixes collected in this release.
- The TCP gateway now pools its HTTP-over-UDS service connections and streams
  already-sized JSON responses without copying them into a second buffer,
  disables Nagle buffering on accepted control-plane connections, and reduces
  hot-route CPU and tail latency while retaining request limits and headers.
- Profile mutations now publish the already-validated profile into only the
  affected typed route caches. Orthogonal mutation-ledger writes no longer
  evict session-stat responses, while session and usage writes still do.
- Host-side process control, descriptor handling, advisory locks,
  descriptor-relative filesystem containment, and private file publication now
  share one `capsem-foundation` Unix layer. Owned descriptors eliminate
  ambiguous close responsibility, expected races retain typed errno-aware
  outcomes, unexpected failures carry operation context, and Citadel prevents
  host consumers from bypassing the boundary while preserving reviewed
  kernel-ABI implementations.
- Repository-generated and reusable state now has one hard cache root:
  `cache/`. Cargo profiles, VM assets, packages, release products, coverage,
  journals, private gate worktrees, and retained prefix products no longer
  spill across root `target/` and ambient `.cg/` directories. Gate paths resolve
  through the typed cache library, and Citadel rejects either legacy root.
- Cargo profiles, uv downloads, Python bytecode, and pnpm packages now use
  policy-owned cache stages. Python and uv reuse whole ABI/source or lockfile
  generations, pnpm workspaces share one content store, Cargo internals are
  never selectively pruned, and gate attempts record typed hit/miss/size data.
  Working-tree gates use a stable content-addressed private source path, and a
  scoped sccache resource normalizes changed paths without leaking its daemon;
  exact fast-test repeats therefore retain Cargo fingerprints across isolation.
- Python and Node advisory checks now run once through checksum-pinned
  OSV-Scanner before the stricter RustSec policy. Exact clean lockfile verdicts
  are cached for one hour, while failures are never cached; the bespoke npm
  registry client, pip-audit exporter, and their redundant dependency installs
  are removed.
- The in-VM benchmark helper now excludes host-only storage, reporting, and
  machine-inspection code. Its stripped musl payload is 32% smaller, reducing
  every fresh VM overlay and keeping fork images within their size ratchet
  without weakening the benchmark baseline.
- Bounded direct diagnostics now reap descendants that create their own process
  sessions, so a timed-out Bubblewrap or focused-gate command cannot keep VMs,
  locks, or output pipes alive after its wrapper exits.
- VM kernels, root filesystems, initrds, guest binaries, host packages, and
  release staging views now reuse digest-verified immutable objects through
  component-specific input identities. Hardlinks avoid duplicate multi-gigabyte
  copies, strict receipts make every reused byte auditable, and runtime boot
  evidence remains fresh rather than being mistaken for construction output.
- `just cache` now reconciles repository usage with owned Docker images,
  containers, persistent per-architecture package compiler volumes, BuildKit
  data, and Tart VMs through bounded typed adapters. Package builds retain
  Cargo fingerprints across gates instead of compiling both targets cold.
  Every owner exposes the same description, scope, maximum size, warm size,
  and prune strategy through `just cache stats`; prune previews protect active
  and foreign resources, and applied cleanup is exact, reasoned, and journaled.
- Complete local tests now refuse low-impact repeats until ten commits have
  accumulated since the latest successful proof and print the exact focused
  owners to run instead. High-impact and unknown changes remain eligible;
  exceptional forced attempts require a journaled reason and cannot occur
  twice consecutively.
- One complete local qualification now executes each behavioral cohort once:
  Node workspaces and Python collection are prepared once, source-contract
  coverage is appended into the later functional result without recollection,
  and digest-verified release staging reuses the fresh VM result instead of
  rerunning the same pytest, injection, and integration work. Hosted binary and
  profile release lanes still run their complete independent qualification.
- Complete local verification is `just test` again and reuses valid
  content-addressed build output between source commits. The cold-only
  `test-full` public command is removed without a compatibility alias. Release
  commands remain sufficient on their own because their hosted lanes perform
  release qualification; `just test` is not a prerequisite.
- Brand and Tauri icon sources now have one canonical owner under
  `web/graphics/`; native packaging, CI, documentation, and web callers no
  longer depend on the retired root or a duplicate crate-local icon set.
- The marketing site now lives under `web/marketing/`; CI, deployment,
  installer validation, coverage, and developer callers follow its functional
  owner without changing the public `/` or `/later/` routes.
- The documentation site now lives under `web/docs/`; CI, deployment,
  coverage, holding-page verification, and developer guidance follow the new
  functional owner without changing public documentation routes.
- The desktop dashboard source now lives under `web/app/`; development,
  packaging, CI, coverage, and generated-settings callers use that single web
  owner instead of the retired `frontend/` root.
- Python engineering tooling now has one locked project under `build_system/`:
  the `capsem-builder` distribution owns both `capsem-builder` and
  `capsem-gate`, and the obsolete root `capsem` distribution, package facade,
  project file, and lockfile are removed to reserve that name for the SDK.

### Added

- `just cache` now provides a typed, repository-owned inventory and retention
  interface. Stats and verification are read-only, pruning previews its exact
  plan unless `--apply` is supplied, and a common registry hides disk,
  Docker/Colima, and Tart mechanisms from callers. Every applied deletion is
  ownership-scoped and journaled with its reason.
- Developer verification now has explicit cost boundaries: `just fast-test`
  prints that it is incomplete, `just focus-test <group>` reruns one existing
  owner (`assets`, `binaries`, `benchmark`, `install`, `release-system`, or
  `functional`), `release-system` stays source-only instead of demanding a
  locally built package, and `just install` builds and installs the complete local
  macOS package for hands-on testing. The duplicate public `vm-smoke` spelling
  is gone, while `just test` remains the reusable complete whole-system proof.
  Publication belongs to the hosted `release-profile` and
  `release-binaries` lanes, which reuse immutable inputs.

- `build_system/scripts/release/write-release-notes.py`: the GitHub release notes are rendered by a
  program with tests instead of a shell heredoc. The heredoc's tag was
  unquoted, which makes backticks command substitution -- so the line meant to
  read ``Qualified source: `<commit>` `` ran the commit hash as a program,
  substituted nothing, and shipped "Qualified source: ." The shell exits 0, so
  `set -euo pipefail` never saw it. An empty value now refuses instead.
- `tests/citadel/test_workflow_heredocs_do_not_run_their_backticks.py`: no
  workflow heredoc may contain a backtick or `$(...)` unless its tag is quoted.
  The two heredocs that legitimately interpolate a coverage number are
  unaffected; substitution is the part that was never wanted.
- `tests/citadel/test_required_jobs_are_derived.py`: the set of CI jobs that
  must pass is derived from the workflow, not restated. Four places had to
  agree -- `jobs:`, `pr-gate.needs:`, `pr-gate.env:`, and the required list in
  `require-ci-jobs.sh` -- and nothing compared them. A job added to the first
  and forgotten in any of the others runs, can fail, and cannot block a merge:
  branch protection stays green because the one required status was never told
  to look. The set is every job except the aggregator, which cannot require
  itself, so it is computed rather than maintained.

### Fixed

- `capsem stop` no longer reports "Service stopped." while another capsem
  service still answers on the socket: it names the socket and fails instead.

- A VM created or resumed with `--network` is plugged into the network's switch
  even when its process is slow to start. The plug was attempted once, before
  the process listened, and never retried, leaving that VM without a cable.

- A VM joining a network receives traffic from the first frame sent after it
  is plugged; the switch reported the plug before it could forward to the new
  port, so a peer that sent immediately lost those frames.

- Under `CAPSEM_HOME`, `capsem stop` and `capsem start` act on the service that
  home's commands started, rather than the machine's installed LaunchAgent or
  systemd unit, which serves the real home. Stop now waits for that service to
  exit after SIGTERM; before, it left it running.

- MCP clients inside a VM no longer hang when they send a large final request
  and close stdin right away: the guest relay ends the session with an in-band
  frame instead of a vsock shutdown the transport could lose.

- A request to a VM owner over its IPC channel no longer occasionally times out
  after eight seconds: the channel released its socket before leaving the
  event loop, and a new connection reusing the number could never wake. About
  one request in two thousand was affected.
- Ledger reads no longer fail with "database table is locked" or stall while the
  writer is busy: `capsem network logs -f` and the session ledger routes read
  through SQLite's `read_uncommitted` on the shared memory tables.

- Published-port connection audits record `unreachable` when the guest bridge
  never came up and `cancelled` when it was lost during setup; both were
  recorded as `stale_generation`, which names only the post-setup recheck.
- Editing or deleting a profile enforcement or detection rule through the API
  now reaches running VMs on that profile before the route returns, as plugin
  edits already did; previously running VMs kept the old rules until an explicit
  profile reload.
- Session ledger routes (`security/latest`, `detection/latest`,
  `security/status`, `timeline`, `history*`, `stats/detail`) read through the
  logger on every request. They no longer serve a cached response while a
  commit sits only in the write-ahead log, which previously hid new rows until
  the next checkpoint.
- Security audit emitters report failed database admission accurately, allowing
  security-sensitive callers to refuse work when the audit writer is closed.

- Guest TCP resets propagate across VSOCK with generation-bound close reports
  and acknowledgments; bounded replay credits prevent stalled control traffic
  from accumulating network reports.
- TCP reset is armed before router handoff, so forced process death also
  closes published connections abruptly; normal completion restores graceful close.
- Abnormal published-connection cleanup resets TCP and revokes socket copies
  retained by the router, while normal completion preserves half-close and trailing bytes.
- Removing an exposed port or losing its router now cancels its guest flows,
  including queued setup, without interrupting other published ports.
- Guest control connections use async I/O with bounded frame deadlines and
  joined reader cleanup on reconnect, so a stalled guest cannot block a host Tokio worker.

- Linux router startup no longer races thread-local libc registration when
  installing confinement; creating new threads remains forbidden.
- Criterion benchmark collection now retains ungrouped cases as well as grouped
  cases, including the built-in security registry measurement, instead of
  silently omitting results outside a directory named after the Cargo target.
- Benchmark collectors clean up their process groups when they finish or time
  out, preventing surviving background work from affecting later measurements.
- Concurrent gateway status polls recover when a leading request is cancelled,
  and lifecycle notifications remain ordered with their service reads.
- Incremental session-ledger refresh fails explicitly if a required disk table
  disappears, instead of serving a stale memory view.
- DNS query deadlines now cover writer queueing, cancellation frees pending
  capacity, and recovered connections discard expired traffic. DNS workers
  close with their owner, response backpressure retains host capacity limits,
  and guest resolver timeouts allow both upstream attempts to finish.
- DNS reuse preserves query flags, options, and question spelling, honors
  zero, absent and alias-limited authoritative TTLs, and ages cached record TTLs. Messages
  with unchecked extra questions or unsupported operations never reach an
  upstream, and response matching preserves DNS label boundaries.
- DNS, HTTP, model, and MCP request completion now includes derived security
  and credential ledger writes, preventing shutdown from losing detached
  audit work. MCP requests and results are serialized once for the ledger,
  the guest relay parses each line once, and built-in security plugins share
  an immutable registry while keeping each evaluation's policy isolated.
- `capsem create` returns as soon as the VM is launched instead of after a
  fixed half-second. The VM process now writes a launch sentinel the
  moment the hypervisor has started the VM and it is answering IPC (about
  100 ms in on Linux); create returns on that, on guest readiness, or on a
  crash, with the old half second kept only as the ceiling. Exec and file
  routes still own the full readiness wait.
- The guest's boot stage timings reach the host again. The agent has always
  sent them after the boot handshake; the process logged them as an
  unknown message and dropped them. They are now recorded per stage in the
  process log, the guest also reports the kernel's own boot time as a
  stage, and the lifecycle benchmark records every stage plus the graceful
  stop and one-shot run times.
- Concurrent `/status` polls no longer queue behind one another at the
  gateway. A poll that finds a service read in flight waits for it and
  then shares the next read, which by construction began after the poll
  arrived, so any number of simultaneous polls (browser, tray, TUI) cost
  at most two service reads and none is ever answered from a read that
  predates it. Status reads also use the gateway's pooled service
  connection instead of a fresh socket and handshake per read, and the
  previous response is no longer copied whole just to diff VM states.
- The proxy's guest-facing TLS configuration is built once per VM instead
  of once per connection. A configuration owns the TLS session cache, so
  every guest connection used to start from an empty cache and pay a full
  handshake; connections from the same client now resume their session.
  The SNI is read back from the finished handshake rather than captured
  by the per-connection resolver.
- The host's vsock listeners accept a real backlog. The queue was four
  connections deep, so a guest opening more than four connections at once
  (a package install, an agent fanning out) had the surplus reset by the
  kernel instead of queued.
- Identical DNS lookups in flight at the same time now share one upstream
  round trip: the first query for a name leads and the rest wait for its
  checked answer, each getting its own transaction id and its own ledger
  row. A query only joins after its own security evaluation, local
  fixtures, redirect check and cache lookup have all passed, so a blocked
  name is never merged with an allowed one, and a leader that fails gives
  every follower its own SERVFAIL. An upstream NXDOMAIN is now remembered
  for the SOA minimum, at most a minute, so a client retrying a dead name
  stops costing an upstream lookup each time; SERVFAIL is still never
  cached. Two hundred concurrent lookups of one dead name used to be two
  hundred upstream datagrams and, on a slow upstream, two hundred timeouts.
- The DNS forwarder's per-upstream timeout is two seconds instead of five,
  so trying both default upstreams fits inside the guest resolver's own
  six-second timeout and the client sees a SERVFAIL rather than
  retransmitting the same query into the backlog.
- Guest DNS no longer serializes on eight lock-step worker threads. The
  forwarder now multiplexes queries over two persistent vsock sessions with a
  correlation id per query, so answers arrive in any order and a slow lookup
  no longer holds every query queued behind it; the host answers each frame
  on its own task. Every answer is checked against its query's transaction
  id and question before it is delivered, a query the host never answers
  gets a SERVFAIL after five seconds instead of silence, and the forwarder
  sheds past 128 in-flight queries per session rather than growing a
  queue. On this KVM host, one client went from 395 to 771 queries per
  second (p50 2.4 ms to 0.9 ms) and the plateau under 10 to 200 clients
  from about 2,200 to about 3,600 queries per second.
- Stopping a VM no longer waits out a fixed timer. The host used to sleep
  two seconds after telling the guest to shut down, and the guest slept the
  same two seconds after signalling its shell instead of waiting for it to
  exit (an interactive bash ignores that signal anyway, so the shell was
  always killed at the end). The guest now hangs the shell up, waits for it
  to be reaped, syncs, and reports `ShutdownComplete`; the host stops the VM
  on that report, with the old timer kept only as a ceiling for a guest that
  never answers. On a KVM host, `capsem stop` of a persistent VM went from
  2.3s to 0.3s and a one-shot `capsem run` from 5.2s to 3.1s. Bash also
  gets the hangup it handles gracefully instead of a kill.
- The session ledger writer reuses prepared statements instead of parsing
  the SQL of every insert again. Under load the writer thread's profile was
  a fifth SQL parsing; write throughput doubled (66,000 to 134,000 events
  per second at 1,024-event batches), which is CPU the proxy gets back and
  requests that no longer wait on a full telemetry queue.
- The guest network proxy no longer serializes the two steps in front of
  every outbound connection: attributing the connecting process from
  `/proc` and opening the vsock to the host now run at the same time, so the
  first byte leaves the guest after the slower of the two rather than their
  sum.
- The DNS forwarder accepts only the answer to the question it asked. It
  used to return the first datagram that arrived on its socket, so a forged
  reply that guessed the ephemeral port could answer for any name (the
  transaction id is the guest's to choose) and be cached for five minutes.
  Every datagram is now checked for the query's id, the response bit and
  the same question; anything else is discarded and the forwarder keeps
  waiting for the real answer.
- The gateway answers 413 for an oversized body whether or not the client
  declared its length. A chunked upload past 10 MiB used to fail on the
  connection to the service and come back as 502 "service unavailable".
  Reading a buffered JSON response from the service is now bounded by the
  same request timeout as sending the request.
- Reading a session ledger from the service no longer copies every hot
  table from disk on every request. The external reader syncs only when
  SQLite reports that another connection committed, and then pulls only the
  rows above its high-water mark for the append-only ledgers (exec events,
  which complete in place, are still copied whole). On a 20,000-row ledger
  a poll with nothing new went from 8 ms to 56 µs and a poll right after a
  write from 10 ms to 1.7 ms; at 200,000 rows, 90 ms to 3 ms and 110 ms to
  4 ms. A new criterion bench keeps both numbers measured.
- Admin image and manifest commands now select the locked builder project
  explicitly, so they work without an activated Python environment.
- Debian installation now gives the existing user service immediate ACL-based
  access to `/dev/kvm` and `/dev/vhost-vsock`, while a packaged udev rule and
  `kvm` membership preserve restricted access across future logins and device
  events. Release proofs no longer mask installer failures with world-writable
  VM devices.
- `capsem logs <id>` now reaches logs preserved after an ephemeral VM fails
  before entering the live-session list. Installed-package verification checks
  this post-mortem path on Linux and macOS, and KVM reports distinguish device
  permission failures from a missing `vhost_vsock` module.
- Invalid or empty built-in HTTP grep patterns are now rejected before DNS or
  network authorization, returning the intended validation error without an
  unnecessary outbound lookup.
- KVM pause now clears prior vCPU snapshots before publishing the pausing
  lifecycle state, so a freshly parked vCPU snapshot cannot be erased by the
  requesting thread under contention.
- Plaintext credential-store updates now use collision-safe sibling files that
  are owner-only before secrets are written, atomically replace the prior
  complete store, and durably sync both file and directory without following a
  predictable temporary-file symlink.
- Saving the persistent VM registry no longer holds its lock while the file
  is written and fsynced. Every list, info and status poll takes that lock to
  read, so each persist, fork, suspend, exit or purge stalled them for the
  length of an fsync (2 to 4 ms on an idle SSD, far more on a busy disk).
  The table is serialized under the lock and written after it is released,
  with writes still landing in the order the table changed.
- The built-in HTTP tools now judge the addresses a host resolves to, not
  only its name, and connect only to the addresses they judged. A name that
  resolved to loopback, a private range or the cloud metadata address
  reached it under a host rule that never mentioned the address, and a name
  whose DNS answer changed between the check and the dial (DNS rebinding)
  reached anything. An `ip.*` block rule now blocks the request whatever the
  name said, a non-public address is reachable only through an explicit
  allow rule, and the connection is pinned to the resolved addresses so a
  re-resolution reaches nothing new. Profiles that let a built-in tool reach
  `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` need an allow rule that names it.
- Service routes no longer block the async runtime on the filesystem. The
  list, info and status routes the UI polls hashed and stat'ed files for
  every saved session on a tokio worker; provision, run, fork, delete,
  purge, suspend, resume, reload and the rule-mutation routes listed
  directories, saved the registry, re-read profile files or spawned the
  child there; the panic and triage routes read every host log there; and
  the asset reconciler hashed multi-gigabyte images there. Every such call
  now goes through one blocking door, and a source contract refuses new
  direct calls, so one slow disk no longer stalls every other request. With
  every runtime worker busy scanning host logs, `/vms/list` went from a p50
  of 25 ms and a p99 of 296 ms to a p50 of 1.5 ms and a p99 of 8 ms; idle
  latency is unchanged at 0.2 ms.
- Legacy IPv4 spellings are judged as the address they dial. The resolver
  reads `0x7f000001`, `127.1`, `0177.0.0.1` and `2130706433` as `127.0.0.1`,
  but host rules, the certificate cache and telemetry saw the spelling, so a
  rule on the dotted quad was evaded by any of them. One host normalizer now
  serves the MITM edge, the security engine and the built-in tools, and
  canonicalizes every `inet_aton` form to the dotted quad before anything
  judges, dials or records it.
- Persisting a running session no longer renames its directory under the
  live process. capsem-process holds that directory by path for the shared
  workspace, auto-snapshots, the file tools and its session ledger, so the
  rename left snapshots, file tools and history failing until the next
  restart. `persist` now claims the name and registers the session where it
  runs; the directory moves to `persistent/<id>` when the process exits, and
  a resume settles it first if that move is still pending. A move that fails
  leaves the entry pointing at the directory that exists.
- The built-in HTTP tools now see an IPv6 literal the way they see an IPv4
  one: `http://[::1]/` reaches the security rules as host `::1` with an
  `ip.version`/`ip.value` event, so a rule that blocks loopback by address
  can no longer be walked around by spelling it in IPv6. Tool URL hosts are
  also lowercased and stripped of a trailing dot before evaluation.
- When a per-VM socket path is too long for the platform limit, the short
  fallback now lives in `/tmp/capsem-<uid>`, created mode 0700 and refused
  unless it is a real directory owned by the current user and readable by
  nobody else. The previous shared `/tmp/capsem` belonged to whichever user
  created it, and any other user of the host could remove a service's socket
  or bind their own at the path clients were handed. The VZ save/restore
  lock file moves into the same directory.
- `GET /vms/{id}/history/transcript` returns what the terminal showed: it
  decodes the output entries of capsem-process's framed `pty.log` instead of
  returning the raw frames with their headers and typed input, honours its
  documented `tail_lines` parameter (default 500), reads the file off the
  async runtime, and reports the bytes it actually returned. The PTY log
  format and its parser now live in `capsem-core`, shared by the writer and
  the route.
- A resumed persistent VM now gets the same exit bookkeeping as a freshly
  provisioned one: it is marked suspended when it checkpoints, defunct with
  the process-log tail when it crashes, and its stop is recorded in the
  session index. The resume path had its own reaper that did none of this.
- Asset manifests reject an architecture key that is not a single path
  component, and release staging refuses to write an asset anywhere but
  `release_dir/<arch>-<name>`.
- The credential broker binds a destination to a provider on a label
  boundary: `evil-openai.com` and `openai.com.evil.example` are no longer
  treated as `openai.com` (or `github.com`, `googleapis.com`, `anthropic.com`,
  `claude.com`), so a brokered reference cannot be dereferenced into the real
  key by a look-alike host. The on-disk credential store takes a
  cross-process lock for each read-modify-write, so two sandboxes capturing
  at once no longer drop each other's entries, and `capsem-mcp` log lines
  print environment keys but never their values.
- Built-in MCP tools clamp guest-supplied `start_index`, `max_length`,
  `context_lines` and `max_matches` before arithmetic, so `u64::MAX` no
  longer panics the builtin subprocess. `snapshots_history` sizes files
  through the contained-directory walker and refuses symlinks and special
  files like the other snapshot tools.
- A WebSocket upgrade now goes through the same gate as every other request:
  the HTTP port allowlist and the security boundary run before the upstream
  is dialed, the decision is recorded in telemetry, and a blocked host gets
  a 403. Previously an `Upgrade: websocket` header on an otherwise blocked
  request reached any host, the gateway included, and was logged as allowed.
- Hostnames are normalized once at the proxy edge: a mixed-case or
  trailing-dot `Host` header or SNI (`API.EVIL.COM.`) is evaluated, minted
  and recorded as the canonical lowercase name, so `http.host` rules can no
  longer be evaded by spelling. The MITM leaf certificate cache is bounded
  to 1024 entries, a guest that opens a connection and stalls before its
  first bytes, its TLS ClientHello or its request headers is timed out
  instead of pinning a task, and an MCP notification takes the endpoint's
  in-flight permit like a request does.
- The guest agent's audit tailer reconnects to the host audit port instead
  of exiting on the first failed write, keeps the frame it could not send
  for the next connection, and bounds its table of partial audit records.
- The service refuses to start when its persistent VM registry file is
  unreadable or corrupt instead of starting with an empty registry and
  overwriting the file on the next persist. Startup hydration keys session
  DB handles by runtime id, the id routes actually use, so persistent
  sessions are served after a restart; a malformed session schema is
  reported as not ready instead of being invisible. `persist` claims the
  name, moves the session directory and registers it as one step under the
  registry lock and moves the directory back if registration is refused;
  `purge` deletes session directories only through the service's contained
  delete path.
- The service's cached ledger statistics can no longer be filled by a query
  that finished after a write invalidated the cache, which had left stale
  counts on `/stats` until the next lifecycle event. The guest agent also
  joins its per-connection writer, heartbeat and control threads before
  reconnecting, so a thread from the old connection can no longer read or
  write the new connection's stream through a reused descriptor number.
- A guest driver reset (STATUS=0) now reaches every KVM virtio device: the
  VirtioFS worker stops and hands its state back, the virtio-blk worker is
  joined instead of leaked beside a second one, the vhost-vsock backend is
  detached, and the console drops its queue, so a driver unbind/rebind
  re-activates cleanly instead of leaving workers on freed guest memory and
  a filesystem that could never come back. Console output descriptors are
  also capped at 64 KiB per copy.
- The KVM VirtioFS server no longer follows guest-created symlinks on the
  host. A hostile guest driver could use a symlink to a host directory as the
  parent of unlink, rename, mkdir, create, mknod, symlink, link or opendir
  requests, create or truncate through a symlink, and chmod, chown, truncate
  or touch a symlink's host target; each of those reached files outside the
  shared workspace with the host user's privileges. A FIFO in the workspace
  could also park the single VirtioFS worker forever. Every parent must now
  be a real in-share directory reached without a symlink, attribute changes
  on a symlink apply to the link itself or are refused, and only regular
  files are opened.
- The guest network proxy no longer closes a vsock descriptor twice when it
  fails to register it with the runtime, which could sever an unrelated
  connection that had just been handed the same descriptor number.
- An MCP tool call to a server that never answers is now cancelled upstream
  when the sandbox stops waiting for it. Each such call used to leave a task
  and a pending request behind in the MCP aggregator for the life of the VM.
- The service, the CLI, and the per-VM process no longer block an async
  worker on a synchronous IPC handshake or on joining a terminal reader
  thread. A slow handshake stalled every request scheduled on that worker,
  and a half-open terminal socket after a resume could park a worker
  indefinitely and leave the new terminal connection unused.
- Asset downloads stop as soon as the origin sends more bytes than the manifest
  declares, and a local asset copy hashes the bytes it actually installs. An
  endless or oversized response used to be written to disk in full before the
  hash check ran, and a local source that changed between hashing and copying
  was installed under a hash-named file it did not match.
- Waiting for the session ledger to flush now reports failure when the disk
  flush did not happen, instead of returning success, and producers waiting
  for a full ledger queue back off instead of spinning a CPU core while the
  writer flushes.
- A user settings or profile file can no longer mark its own rules
  `corp_locked`. The flag unlocked the corp priority band and the corp-owned
  marker, so a user `allow` at priority -1000 outranked a corp `block`; only
  corp config may set it now, and such a file is refused at load.
- A profile whose security rules fail to compile now refuses to start or
  reload instead of running with no rules. The merged rule set was replaced
  by an empty one behind a log warning, and the engine allows any event no
  rule matches, so one broken rule silently disabled every other one.
- Process audit events now use the security rules in force when each record
  arrives. The guest opens its audit stream once at boot, and the host had
  frozen the rule set at that moment, so a profile edit that reloaded every
  other rail left process rules at their boot-time version until the VM
  restarted.
- A sandbox command that finishes while the guest is reconnecting to the host
  (for example right after a suspend and resume) now reports its exit code.
  The exit message used to go to the previous connection's writer, which had
  already exited, and the host waited for it indefinitely.
- MCP tool calls from inside the sandbox no longer fail with a spurious
  "connection closed" error when a tool takes longer than 30 seconds or when
  the relay sits idle for 30 seconds between calls. The guest relay inherited
  the control channel's receive timeout although its transport has no
  keepalive, so every long call or quiet stretch tore the connection down.
- A sandbox environment variable whose value has a multibyte character at the
  40-character mark no longer crashes the guest agent during boot, which left
  the VM never becoming ready.
- Reading a guest file larger than one control frame (2 MiB) no longer wedges
  the sandbox control channel. The guest replied with a frame the host could
  never decode, so it was never acknowledged and was replayed on every
  reconnect for the life of the VM, taking exec, file operations and snapshots
  with it. The guest now answers with an error, the host discards an
  oversized frame and keeps the connection, and an oversized host-to-guest
  file write is refused immediately with the reason.
- The gateway refuses any request whose `Host` header is not `localhost`,
  `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`. Before, a web page whose DNS answer flipped to the
  loopback address (DNS rebinding) could fetch `/token` as a same-origin
  loopback caller and hold full authority over the gateway. Request spans also
  no longer record the query string, which carried the WebSocket `?token=`
  into `gateway.log`, and token comparison no longer short-circuits on the
  first differing byte.
- Security rule string literals now decode their escape sequences. A rule whose
  value held a quote, a backslash, or a newline -- every Sigma-derived selection
  and every managed MCP tool permission is emitted JSON-escaped -- compiled and
  silently never matched; a corp regex written as `\\.` reached the engine as a
  literal backslash. `\\ \" \' \/ \n \t \r \xHH \uHHHH` are decoded; other
  backslash sequences such as `\.` and `\d` still reach `matches()` verbatim.
- The sandbox files API (list, download, upload) no longer follows symlinks
  the guest plants in the shared workspace. Every path component is opened
  with `O_NOFOLLOW` relative to the workspace root, so an upload to a dangling
  link or below a symlinked directory is refused instead of writing to the
  host filesystem, and a linked host file or directory is neither served nor
  listed.
- KVM VirtioFS and console devices now validate the complete guest-controlled
  descriptor range before reading or writing host memory, and zero-sized
  virtqueues are rejected without a host-process panic.
- Brokered credential references now refuse substitution when the destination
  has no matching provider binding, preventing a guest from redirecting a
  stored provider secret to an unrelated domain.
- Cache pressure cleanup now honors each owned image repository's retention
  count before trimming BuildKit to its total-byte target, and rootfs cache
  identities include the exact asset-tools image used for EROFS and inventory.
- Cache control now separates shared storage authority from qualified-source
  policy, preserves leased and structural entries, enforces generation and
  free-space limits, reports typed health, and reuses Rust compilation through
  the pinned sccache toolchain with a cache-owned daemon endpoint.
- Python lock auditing now uses the shared repository HTTP cache and bounded
  retries for transient advisory-service failures, while vulnerability results
  still fail immediately and requirement hashes are validated through PyPI.
- MITM forwarding now rejects disallowed plain-HTTP upstream ports before the
  host dials them, and gzip collection rejects decompression beyond its bounded
  payload limit instead of allowing a compressed body to exhaust host memory.
- Complete local qualification now retains the shared Cargo build directory
  even when it crosses its advisory size threshold; only an explicit cold-build
  diagnostic may discard reusable compiler output.
- Session deletion now absorbs transient Linux `ENOTEMPTY` races from final
  SQLite or filesystem cleanup after VM exit, while remaining bounded and
  fail-closed for persistent or unrelated filesystem errors.
- MITM response telemetry now applies async backpressure at HTTP completion
  when the bounded logger queue fills, preserving every session-ledger event
  under high request concurrency instead of dropping the saturated tail.
- Suspend now treats the guest's `Suspended` state as an acknowledgement and
  waits for the VM process to exit before allowing resume, preventing Apple VZ
  checkpoint restores from racing the old process's checkpoint ownership.
- Parent-watched companions now terminate before attempting best-effort
  reparenting logs, so a launcher that closes their stdout/stderr pipes cannot
  strand a gateway, tray, MCP server, or mock server on PID 1 holding its
  sockets.
- VM launch and resume now publish instance state before starting child-exit
  cleanup, preventing fast process failures from leaving phantom running VMs.
- File validation now rejects `..` only as a parent-directory component, so
  legitimate filenames such as `data..backup.txt` are accepted.
- Handshake peers now decode legacy `Hello` messages that predate the optional
  trace context field, preserving typed schema/version mismatch diagnostics.
- Parent-watch thread creation failures now return a structured guard error
  instead of panicking during companion startup.
- Companion singleton guards now retain stable in-process lock identity when a
  lockfile is replaced during acquisition.
- Guest terminal output now appends to `serial.log` on a dedicated writer
  thread instead of blocking a Tokio worker on synchronous disk I/O.
- Concurrent exec commands now keep independent output capture and completion
  state instead of overwriting one shared active slot.
- HTTP, DNS, MCP, process, and file security paths now share immutable plugin
  policy snapshots instead of deep-cloning the policy map for each event.
- The MCP aggregator now exits its request reader after a framing error instead
  of parsing subsequent bytes from a desynchronized stream.
- Built-in HTTP tools now bound connection setup and the complete request,
  including response-body reads, so stalled upstreams cannot occupy handlers
  indefinitely.
- MCP discovery protocol events no longer trigger unnecessary tool-ledger
  flushes or inflate persisted logger-write metrics.
- Logger writes now use a bounded operation queue with real async and blocking
  backpressure instead of accumulating unbounded batches in memory.
- Model-item deduplication now stays database-owned instead of retaining every
  item key in process memory for the lifetime of a session.
- The gateway proxy now removes hop-by-hop and connection-nominated request
  headers before forwarding requests to the service.
- Gateway status reads now bound their service response time, body size, and
  background connection lifetime so a stalled or oversized response cannot
  block status polling indefinitely.
- Apple VZ serial consoles now close their duplicated pipe descriptors when a
  VM handle is dropped instead of leaking descriptors across VM lifecycles.
- Security decision rows now record the same first matching enforcement rule
  that the runtime actually applies.
- Truncated gzip response headers are now forwarded intact instead of being
  silently dropped when the upstream stream ends during classification.
- Malformed model-request fallbacks now reuse their compiled field matcher
  instead of rebuilding it for every request.
- MCP catalogs now ignore duplicate namespaced tool definitions instead of
  advertising ambiguous entries.
- Manifest merges now compare numeric version components, so multi-digit asset
  and binary revisions remain ordered correctly.
- Snapshot change lists and workspace hashes now detect content edits that
  preserve a file's byte length.

- Guest network attribution now checks recently active processes before
  scanning every process file descriptor for each outbound connection.

- Guest process attribution now handles long Unicode process names without
  crashing MCP or network relay tasks.

- Agent terminal reconnects now shut down and join the previous terminal
  reader before reusing its file descriptor, preventing stale readers from
  corrupting input or spinning after a disconnect.

- Release transitions now always begin from the latest verified stable
  manifest. Stable releases no longer depend on mutable nightly state, and a
  nightly release explicitly switches from stable to the candidate nightly
  graph instead of treating the previous nightly as its baseline.

- Failed `capsem doctor` sessions now retain their per-VM process, serial, and
  ledger evidence instead of destructively deleting it after an IPC loss or
  diagnostic failure. Hosted qualification also captures the service log, and
  one-shot runs delete successful ephemeral state while preserving failed IPC
  sessions for diagnosis.

- Linux automatic binary updates now run the complete verified update
  transaction as an independent transient user service. Stopping
  `capsem.service` during Debian package replacement can no longer kill its
  own updater and leave `dpkg` halfway through the install. Direct systemd
  ownership is now identified by the service process ID as well as its
  invocation ID, so inherited runner or desktop-session variables cannot send
  unrelated child services through that path. When the update is initiated by
  an older installed service that predates this rail, the new package detects
  its service-owned `dpkg` transaction and preserves the old process cohort
  until manifest activation requests the managed restart. Its Debian
  postinstall now also defers manifest hydration, service registration, and
  readiness to that old updater, instead of either rejecting the unpublished
  candidate against the previous public manifest or probing the new client
  against the deliberately preserved old service before `apt` can return.

- `just install` now opens the native macOS administrator authorization dialog
  for the exact package install instead of depending on terminal `sudo` state,
  so bounded agent runs can complete without an interactive TTY.

- `just install` now packages the exact base-profile asset/config pair that
  Ironbank built and verified, instead of reopening the checkout's canonical
  `assets` symlink. A cold macOS install can therefore reuse the assembled
  content without weakening the package rail's symlink-traversal guard.

- Native installs now validate and activate the release manifest without
  synchronously downloading VM images. The service hydrates missing,
  hash-verified profile assets in the background, preserves resumable partial
  downloads, and exposes visible progress on profile cards while session
  creation remains blocked until the selected profile is ready. CLI JSON also
  preserves the immediate background-start acknowledgement for release probes.

- Native package upgrades now retire the exact installed service/helper cohort
  before replacing signed binaries, including an orphan whose command line has
  collapsed to only `capsem-service`. The public installer first requests a
  normal user-level service stop; package scripts then verify user, executable,
  and PID-file ownership before forcing any remaining helper to exit.

- The desktop toolbar once again shows live input, thinking, and output tokens,
  tool-call count, and estimated cost for the selected session. It polls one
  compact logger-owned summary instead of querying every running VM or loading
  the full statistics report.

- The public marketing homepage once again exposes the supported installer and
  stable-channel download instead of the temporary Summer 2026 holding page;
  release glowup now refuses source whose public install command is hidden.

- Persistent named VMs now resume from their saved validated runtime profile,
  rootfs geometry, and immutable asset pins instead of being invalidated or
  overwritten when the currently selected profile advances. Deprecated pins
  remain usable by existing VMs; missing/corrupt saved state and explicit
  profile or image revocation still fail closed.

- The terminal UI now keeps immutable session UUIDs behind the routing boundary
  and consistently shows human session names in tabs, lifecycle prompts,
  confirmations, and action results. Its deterministic Ratatui interaction
  suite now covers create, stop, resume, navigation, help, measured gateway
  latency, and rendered-screen state.

- Production activation now retries exact static-file snapshot comparison through CDN propagation instead of rolling back on one stale file.

- Complete release-channel validation now follows the public catalog instead of requiring intentionally absent channels.

- Failed release deployment can now resume from its already-verified channel artifact without rebuilding or repeating qualification.

- Allow a verified release to repair an already-broken production channel while retaining exact rollback-byte proof.

- Binary release monitoring now reattaches to the same authoritative GitHub
  Actions run after a transient `gh run watch` API failure. A temporary 5xx no
  longer reports a false release failure, deletes the newly claimed version
  tag, or tempts a duplicate dispatch; a completed red workflow still fails
  closed.

- Destructive VM delete and purge no longer query the per-session ledger they
  are erasing. An interrupted or partially initialized ledger can no longer
  make `purge --all` fail after process teardown and leave the VM registered.

- macOS qualification now keeps Linux-only bootstrap/process fixture mechanics
  on the Linux lane, makes temporary Git repositories independent of developer
  identity and signing configuration, and copies private-prefix Git objects
  instead of hardlinking through Seatbelt. Focused groups also carry their
  owning machine lock and remain safe for generic gate introspection.

- Cold macOS qualification now queues concurrent advisory queries through its
  deliberately single-command egress broker, and materializes only missing,
  exactly pinned Rust targets, components, and Cargo tools through that same
  narrow capability. A fresh Mac no longer fails before artifact work while
  compilation remains inside the loopback-only kernel sandbox.

- Release-channel publication now captures the exact prior Cloudflare Pages
  production deployment, validates every generated public file on an immutable
  preview, and requires production to match both that byte snapshot and the
  action's canonical deployment ID. A failed upload or post-activation check
  restores the prior deployment and revalidates its catalog and manifest
  bytes, while the preview-only staging workflow is structurally unable to
  touch production.

- Installed release qualification now binds every transition verdict to the
  exact manifest bytes fetched and handled by the product. The shared fixture
  transport is explicitly non-cacheable, and Linux plus macOS proofs cover
  fresh activation, a real update, tampered-artifact rejection,
  incompatibility rejection, and exact preservation of the last activated
  state instead of inferring success from log text or elapsed time. Tamper
  candidates now target a config or VM image consumed by the exact installed
  architecture, so an unrelated architecture or evidence-only mutation cannot
  create a vacuous rejection test.

- The daily nightly scheduler now runs both profile lanes and the binary lane
  before returning one aggregate verdict. A failed or unlaunchable profile no
  longer prevents the other profile or binaries from producing their own
  result; structured logs identify every lane against the one frozen source
  commit while the public release commands retain their existing locks,
  workflow waits, and teardown ownership.

- Release preflight, install CI, and Live Channel Watch now share one typed,
  fail-closed interpretation of published, absent, retired, unreachable, and
  invalid channels. Catalog-selected manifests are fetched, SHA-256 verified,
  and structurally validated, so an HTML fallback cannot masquerade as a live
  graph. Install CI uses the exact public graph after activation and the latest
  immutable staged profile cohort while stable is explicitly retired; the
  watcher skips genuinely absent channels but still reports broken references
  from retired catalog members.

- Guest file-write responses no longer wait for an unrelated full session-DB
  flush after their ledger rows have been accepted. A busy ledger could hold a
  successful VM write past the service's 30-second IPC deadline; failures now
  identify both the VM and the guest-completion stage. Session-scoped test
  homes are preserved for any worker failure and exported from private gate
  prefixes, so release-pairing failures retain their process and gate evidence.

- Doctor and test mock servers now exit when their launcher dies. A crashed
  launcher previously released the shared flock while its child kept the fixed
  fixture port bound, leaving later parallel qualification unable to start any
  mock server despite correctly acquiring the lock.

- Valid install and VM-image products are now mandatory warm-cache hits instead
  of optional rebuild shortcuts. Exact receipts bind source, config, helper,
  Docker runtime, platform, image identity, size, and retained bytes; VM assets
  use content-addressed generations. Docker's aligned runtime-identity output is
  normalized before hashing while malformed shapes still fail closed.
  Config-owned count, age, and byte limits evict unpinned products
  deterministically while preserving active/resumable qualifications, and
  impossible pinned pressure now fails closed. Retained prefixes keep their own
  install receipt when the shared cache is lent onward, so Docker cleanup cannot
  erase the exact images needed to resume them.

- Warm VM asset lanes are now a verified cache rather than a matching stamp
  that preflight deleted before use. The identity covers the builder/admin
  implementation, full guest/profile/config inputs, Rust and Python locks,
  toolchain, file modes, and symlink targets; a receipt binds that identity to
  every output path, mode, size, and digest. Preflight retains only isolated
  lane roots, while missing, extra, changed, partial, or semantically invalid
  output rebuilds from a clean directory. Resumed lane and initrd-pack steps
  revalidate their receipts before they can be carried.

- Exact-source candidate qualification can still resume recursively proven
  work, but public release attempts and release CI now reject explicit
  `--from`, `--prefix`, and `--until`. The publication graph previously derived
  carried steps from graph shape alone, so a named frontier could skip fresh
  qualification acceptance, remote-main validation, preflight, or mutable
  channel resolution without any prior-attempt journal proving that work.

- `pip` moves to 26.2.1. PYSEC-2026-3721 was published against 26.1.2, which
  the lock pinned transitively through `pip-api` under `pip-audit` -- the audit
  tool's own dependency tripping the audit. Only that one package changed.

- The Debian package installs on a machine that has `systemctl` but is not
  running systemd -- a container, most obviously. The post-install guarded
  service registration with `command -v systemctl`, which tests for the binary;
  the desktop dependencies pull systemd in, so in a container the binary is
  there while PID 1 is something else and `systemctl --user` has no manager to
  reach. Registration failed and dpkg left the package unconfigured. It now
  also requires `/run/systemd/system`, which is `sd_booted(3)` -- systemd's own
  answer to whether it is the init system -- and records
  `event=service_registration_skipped` rather than skipping silently. Nothing
  caught this because the job that installs the candidate in a container has
  been skipped in every binary release attempt so far, so the path had never
  run.

- A profile's declared binary floor now survives being projected into a runtime
  asset manifest. `capsem-admin profile materialize` read `min_capsem_version`
  from a release-graph profile and wrote an empty `min_binary`, so re-authoring
  a channel from that manifest produced profiles with no floor at all and the
  release lane's glow-up refused them. Nothing reached that path locally: the
  local install proof materializes from `config/profiles`, where the field is
  read from source rather than from a graph.

- Both release commands now refuse a working tree with uncommitted changes.
  A release publishes one immutable commit and runs from a detached copy of it,
  so anything still in the tree is silently excluded -- correct, and quiet
  enough that a fix could be written, verified by hand, released, and appear to
  have done nothing. `source.worktree-clean` is the first step of both plans and
  names what is dirty alongside both remedies; `just release-binaries <channel>
  <commit> true` (or `release-profile ... true`) forces past it when the
  difference is deliberate.

- CI no longer reaches into private `just` recipes, and the nightly rebuild can
  finally run unattended. Each release lane calls one public verb --
  `qualify-assets` or `qualify-binaries` -- instead of assembling three or four
  `_test-*` steps in YAML, which is how the asset lane grew a deferred-profile
  branch the binary lane never had. `fast-test` calls the canonical source
  module shared with CI and release lanes but is explicitly incomplete; named
  focus groups expose existing functional owners without creating another test
  graph. A Citadel guard refuses any workflow that calls a private recipe or
  one absent from the locked public surface. Both release lanes qualify the
  frozen source and immutable selected inputs they publish, without a
  developer-machine journal prerequisite.

- A private release prefix no longer parses the outer checkout's
  `config/gate.toml`. The prefix runs the selected commit's gate code, so
  reading the working tree's config validated one tree's file against the other
  tree's schema: any key added on `main` made every already-qualified commit
  unreleasable, failing on a file the release neither needs nor can use. The
  outer checkout is now rebased onto the prefix's own settings rather than
  re-parsed, since only its location matters -- that is where the retained
  journals live.

- `capsem-core` now compiles for musl, so the host cohort can be built for
  Alpine. `libc::ioctl` takes its request as `c_ulong` on glibc and `c_int` on
  musl, which made 40 of the 41 errors; they are now one `cfg`-selected
  `IoctlRequest` alias that resolves to exactly what was written before on
  glibc. The 41st was `libc::pthread_t` being an integer on glibc and a pointer
  on musl, which silently made `VcpuControl` `Sync` on one libc and not the
  other -- the vCPU thread spawn stopped compiling on that alone. The handle is
  now a `VcpuThread` newtype whose `Send` says why it is sound: an opaque thread
  identity, never dereferenced, only passed to `pthread_kill`. `capsem` and
  `capsem-admin` built for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` run on Alpine 3.21
  through 3.24.

- The platform support claim is now one config-owned value, proved against
  real images. `config/gate.toml` `[platforms]` lists every release the glow-up
  suite runs the package on; the proof reads each image's actual libc, requires
  the binaries to run exactly where the declared floor says and to be refused
  everywhere else, and fails if a release's recorded libc disagrees with the
  image. Ten releases are covered: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04/26.04, Debian
  12/13, and Alpine 3.21-3.24. The floors were previously written out longhand
  in both public `install.sh` copies, the Tauri bundle, the README and the
  docs, with nothing comparing them, and they had drifted -- the installers
  refused anything below macOS 14 while the app bundle advertised 13.0, so the
  bundle promised a release the installer denied. The bundle now says 14.0 and
  a Citadel guard keeps every surface, including the README badges, agreeing
  with the config.

- Debian packages now declare the glibc floor their binaries actually require.
  `Capsem_0.6.0_arm64.deb` declared `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0, libgtk-3-0, libxdo3`
  and no libc at all while every shipped binary needed GLIBC_2.39, so on Debian
  bookworm (2.36) and Ubuntu 22.04 (2.35) `apt install` succeeded -- every
  declared dependency was satisfiable -- and then every binary died with
  "version `GLIBC_2.39' not found". The floor is now derived from the packaged
  bytes by `build_system/packaging/linux/derive-deb-libc-floor.py` rather than hand-written beside
  the GUI libraries, so apt refuses an unusable install instead of completing a
  broken one.

- The nightly release schedule now freezes one commit and dispatches all three
  hosted qualifying lanes against it. The previous scheduler required a
  machine-local candidate journal that a fresh runner could not possess, so
  every run since 2026-08-05 failed before artifact qualification began.
  Profile and binary lanes now qualify the exact immutable inputs they may
  publish and need no developer-machine journal.

- Supervisor SIGTERM now unwinds the gate through its ordinary cancellation
  and run-log lifecycle instead of terminating Python in place. Interrupted
  exact-source qualifications therefore emit a terminal failed journal,
  archive it under the selected commit, release their live lock, and retain
  only graph-proven work for an automatic continuation.

- Publishable guest rootfs assets now reject unexplained growth both before
  and after EROFS compression, with a 950 MB packed ceiling. Code and co-work
  profiles remove and then prove the absence of Ollama CUDA, HIP, JetPack,
  oneAPI, OpenCL, ROCm, and Vulkan bundles from both vendor install roots; a
  config-owned 64 KiB LZ4HC physical cluster keeps the complete payload below
  that ceiling, and a fast Citadel guard prevents either regression from
  returning. An
  interrupted immutable publication may also reconcile its release title to
  the new exact qualified source before the source manifest is published;
  completed releases remain immutable and refuse any title mismatch.

- Exact-commit qualification now describes the same initrd graph before and
  after guest-agent staging. Freshness is evaluated by the typed action at
  execution time, while resumed staging is revalidated before it can be
  carried; a retained prefix can therefore resume without deleting a graph
  node merely because the preceding attempt produced its cache. The same
  conditional helper rail preserves macOS/Colima behavior without needless
  pulls when staging is already current.

- Hosted profile and binary pairing jobs now run the same narrow Linux
  sandbox repair-and-proof primitive as the reusable fast gate before fetching
  Rust inputs or entering a private gate module. A workflow-wide inventory
  guard rejects any future Ubuntu module caller that merely installs
  Bubblewrap without proving loopback-only, direct-egress-denied operation.

- Cold or retired channels can now publish a verified profile cohort inactive
  before they have a current package. The deferred lane uses a dedicated
  private gate module for manifest verification and real KVM boot, while the
  active lane still requires the complete package/profile qualification; it no
  longer invents or selects a package merely to reach the deferred boundary.

- Profile release asset jobs now run the canonical Linux bootstrap before
  entering `build-assets`, so fresh ARM64 and x86_64 runners have the complete
  config-owned Doctor toolchain. A parsed Citadel guard rejects missing, late,
  or fail-open bootstrap steps before hosted asset builds.

- Installed Winterfell qualification now disables pytest's cache provider. The
  lifecycle proof is read-only, so a passing test run no longer fails while
  trying to create cache files beneath the sealed `/src` mount. Its typed test
  fixture also removes three `not-subscriptable` diagnostics from the exact Ty
  debt ratchet instead of leaving stale capacity behind.

- Release-contract plan inspection now uses the shared disposable checkout and
  seeds frozen-source prerequisites only inside that copy. Inspectors can reach
  source-derived image actions without overwriting a live qualification's
  source receipt, while real gates still require isolated bytecode and exact
  image receipts. Both inspection copy stages use the actual host filesystem
  primitive even when rendering another platform's plan. Timing policy also
  has its own schema module, preserving the 300-line gate-module ceiling
  instead of ratcheting it upward, and the removed suppression is ratcheted
  out of the exact debt budget.

- Install qualification images now build from the immutable source snapshot
  captured by `source.record`, then persist a strict helper/source/tag/image
  receipt. Smoke and same-commit resume revalidate that receipt instead of
  hashing the concurrently tested workspace again, so transient Rust coverage
  metadata churn cannot assign two tags to one eventual source state. The
  filesystem observer recognizes only that exact config-owned tree as copied
  source content while retaining its hardlink, mode, and contention checks.

- The first 0.6 profile release can retire the one known pre-0.6 stable graph
  whose package URLs point at a deleted GitHub release. Retirement is bound to
  the configured channel plus the exact catalog and payload SHA-256, authored
  only by `capsem-admin`, and projected as an empty inactive before-state;
  arbitrary 404s, changed graphs, other channels, or forged empty sources still
  fail closed. First-channel authoring now also carries the qualified source
  commit through the hidden bootstrap rail.

- Linux Rust qualification now Clippy-checks `capsem-core` for the configured
  non-native GNU architecture before its native workspace pass. Bootstrap,
  Doctor, CI, and the sealed host builder consume one four-target inventory,
  so ARM-only or x86-only lint failures cannot first appear on the other
  hosted runner. Each typed architecture now also owns its APT cross-compiler
  packages; native provisioning installs and proves the foreign compiler, and
  the Docker/Colima builder consumes the same config-owned union rather than a
  private package list.

- Every Astro build on the host now takes one repository-derived file lock.
  The gate's in-process `astro_build` claim could not coordinate pytest, a
  second gate, or a direct script invocation, while the test helper's old
  `$TMPDIR` lock split callers across different lock files. All entry points
  now serialize the shared Astro staging directory through the same lock. The
  shared lock primitive uses util-linux `flock` when available and Python's
  standard-library `fcntl` fallback on macOS, so neither bootstrap nor Doctor
  requires a Homebrew-only command.

- The gate's machine lock and holder record are now user-scoped, so linked
  worktrees, independent clones, and detached qualification prefixes cannot
  run destructive gates concurrently against shared host state.

- Exact-commit qualification is now durable, reusable evidence instead of work
  repeated by every release request. Complete candidate journals short-circuit
  with their original run ID, path, and digest; failed journals may resume only
  graph-proven ancestors from the retained full-SHA prefix. Release commands
  revalidate that content-addressed chain before dispatch and never infer proof
  from a skill, marker, guessed continuation, or mutable checkout state.

- Exact-package install qualification now converts the selected legacy asset
  projection into a release graph before recording the package and its source
  commit, then regenerates the channel catalogs from that stamped graph. The
  gate, Linux glow-up, and macOS glow-up share that graph-first primitive, so
  provenance remains fail-closed while every native install proof receives the
  authoritative graph it is designed to hydrate from. Its environment key and
  graph path are supplied by typed gate configuration rather than re-authored
  inside the primitive.

- Profile staging permits an unlocked dependency list only in historical
  profile documents that predate source-commit provenance, warning loudly on
  every use. Source-stamped profiles fail closed, so the compatibility bridge
  expires automatically as each legacy profile is republished instead of
  becoming a permanent warning-only escape hatch.

- The staging check and the Rust profile contract now name the same pairs.
  They had drifted: Rust paired npm packages with their lock and staging did
  not, so a profile could carry packages without a lock and be refused later,
  or never, depending which side saw it first.

- Agent session startup now reports bounded GitHub trunk health before the
  local gate digest. Cancelled and unfinished jobs cannot clear a completed
  failure streak, and missing or indeterminate GitHub evidence renders as
  unknown rather than green.

- Fork and lifecycle performance gates now ratchet against the latest
  checked-in benchmark evidence with a config-owned relative limit instead of
  independently authored millisecond and MiB ceilings. The ratchet exposed and
  fixed generic exponential polling that doubled VM delete latency; destructive
  delete now claims the instance once and tears down disposable state directly,
  while retained stop still drains filesystem and WAL owners.

- Hot profile-status reads now share one immutable response cache and compare
  exact manifest-byte identities before rebuilding it. This removes repeated
  manifest parsing, validation, and allocation from UI polling without allowing
  same-size edits to reuse stale status. Linux sparse-copy fallback also scans
  allocated extents at filesystem-block granularity so isolated nonzero blocks
  cannot expand into MiB-sized fork artifacts.

- Exported guest root filesystems now persist npm's global prefix and keep its
  command directory extensible. Locked profile tools are bridged into a real
  `/opt/ai-clis/bin` directory instead of replacing it with a symlink, so a
  later offline or local `npm install -g` produces a runnable command. A fast
  Citadel guard protects both filesystem requirements before asset builds.

- Test processes spawned by an immutable-commit release no longer leak the
  parent gate's source marker into synthetic checkout tests; release identity
  remains fail-closed in production while each test must opt into it explicitly.

- Python lint tooling now pins the last verified cross-platform `hadolint-py`
  cohort. The newer macOS wheel matched its published digest but contained a
  corrupt deflate stream; a fast Citadel guard now makes future tool-cohort
  changes explicit instead of discovering them during hosted Mac setup.

- Binary qualification no longer depends on changelog or `LATEST_RELEASE.md`
  bookkeeping. The remote immutable tag is the sole release transition, and
  the GitHub release title and notes record the full qualified source commit;
  changelog organization may happen afterward.

- Linux bootstrap now treats a working Docker CLI and Buildx as an existing
  container-runtime stack. Installing an unrelated missing prerequisite on a
  GitHub runner no longer also requests Ubuntu's `docker.io`, which conflicts
  with the runner's Docker CE `containerd.io`; a cold host still installs the
  full Docker stack, and a host missing only Buildx installs only that piece.

- Release profile staging now treats every file named by `profile.toml` as one
  manifest-owned closure. Python requirements and their exact lock must be
  declared and transported together; a source-stamped half-pair or a graph
  that omits declared bytes fails before package and install work instead of
  reaching a late materialization error or resolving an unlocked dependency.

- The fast CI gate now runs on every pull request, including documentation-only
  changes, so Ruff, Ty, dependency audits, and source contracts cannot be
  skipped by path classification. The remaining heavy-job shortcut is owned
  by one tested, NUL-delimited classifier that fails closed for empty,
  executable, installer, workflow, test, and unknown paths; branch protection
  always requires the fast gate to succeed.

- Run-history ledger and digest updates now use the gate's atomic filesystem
  primitive instead of writing paths directly. Retained hardlinks keep their
  original bytes, a replaced symlink cannot redirect evidence into another
  run, and the Citadel once again rejects either module reaching around the
  primitive boundary.
- `fast.clippy` claims `workspace_binaries`, and the measurement that settles
  it is recorded rather than the argument that preceded it. The claim was
  withheld on the theory that a step-level exclusive is coarser than the lock
  cargo takes on its own target directory. Measured back to back on one
  machine: 3m47s without, 3m49s with. Cargo was already serialising those
  steps -- clippy's 2m20s of "execution" without the claim was 1m27s of work
  plus about fifty seconds blocked on that lock, charged to execution because
  nothing had declared it. Declaring it moves the wait into the queueing
  report instead of adding it.

- Clippy no longer waits on work it does not read. `web.frontend` was a
  type-check, a unit-test run and a build in one step, and clippy -- which
  needs only `web/app/dist` -- waited on all three, and through them on
  `audit.generated-settings`, because the generated mock those tests import
  made the whole step depend on an `mcp_export` build. Split into
  `web.frontend-build` and `web.frontend-verify`, with the generated-settings
  edge on the verify half. By the numbers of the run that confirmed it, clippy
  starts about two minutes forty-five earlier.
- Five gate steps drove `cargo` while claiming nothing. Two of them could
  overlap, and cargo locks its target directory, so they serialised through a
  lock the gate had never declared -- charging the wait to execution time,
  where the queueing report cannot see it. They now claim
  `workspace_binaries`; every holder of that exclusive was already ordered
  against them, so this declares the contention rather than adding any.
- `prepare.clean-stale` deleted stale files *and* verified the generated
  settings, the second of which builds Rust. Split, so one step is one
  measurement and the build is attributable.
- `web.release-site` declared `COMPILE` and held the Astro exclusive after its
  build moved to `web.release-channel`; the declaration was written once for a
  list of four surfaces and outlived the thing it described. Kind and claim now
  come per target from `[websurfaces] building`.
- `Arch` carried its own copy of the architecture spellings while
  `[architectures]` already owned them -- a second list of exactly the kind
  centralising that table was meant to end. Its members now hold no value, and
  a new contract holds their names to the config.
- `build_system/tests/gate/test_gate_scheduling_analysis.py` was never registered in
  `[suites] source_contract`, so nothing scheduled it.

### Added

- One shape for every guard exclusion (`capsem.gate.exclusions`): exact,
  hashed over the *parsed* form, with a reason the schema checks the length of,
  and reconciled in both directions so an entry that no longer applies fails
  as loudly as a new finding. Two wrong shapes were tried first and are
  recorded because both look reasonable -- a per-file count, which fails on a
  harmless addition and passes on a dangerous change to something already
  listed; and a list of tolerant program names, which misclassified four of
  the five findings it produced.
- `tests/citadel/test_discarded_verdicts_are_declared.py`: every
  `command || true` across scripts, Dockerfile `RUN` and workflow `run:` is
  ledgered with its reason. None is a bug today; the shape is ledgered because
  `test "$X" = success || true` once satisfied a release contract while branch
  protection was off, and an exit status thrown away leaves no trace anywhere.
- `tests/citadel/test_docker_run_fails_closed.py`: a `RUN` sequencing several
  statements must `set -e`. Docker runs the body through `/bin/sh -c`, so the
  instruction's status is the *last* command's. Not the rule GitHub Actions
  needs -- `run:` executes under `bash -e {0}` -- and assuming it was would
  have filed thirty-eight false reports.
- `shellsniff`: the shell tools warn when handed a container of shell rather
  than shell. A raw `.j2` template lexes without error and yields confident
  nonsense, which is how the Docker guard's first version reported a correctly
  chained `make && ls` as two unguarded statements.

- A shell lexer and parser (`shelllex`, `shellnodes`, `shellparse`), because
  every question this repository asks of shell was being asked with a pattern.
  Each worked on the case it was written for and failed quietly on the next:
  `cargo` in a filename, in a comment, on the left of an assignment or inside a
  quoted argument is not `cargo` in command position, and the distinction is
  grammatical rather than textual. The tree also models `&&` and `||`, so
  `test "$X" = success || true` -- a check whose verdict is discarded, the
  shape that once satisfied a release contract while branch protection was off
  -- is a question anyone can now ask with `suppressed()`.

  Its own suite found four bugs in it before any consumer did: a heredoc body
  read as shell, `2>&1` parsed as two arguments, `function name` reporting
  every function as named "function", and `;;` skipped as an ordinary
  separator, which ran every arm of a `case` together into the first.

- `tests/citadel/test_step_actions_are_atomic.py`: a step that reaches a
  compiler must claim the workspace and may not declare a kind that asserts it
  builds nothing. `web.release-site` spent one minute fifty-nine in
  `cargo run -p capsem-admin` behind a name that said "web", and every
  instrument reported it correctly -- one opaque line, for a step that was not
  the unit anyone thought it was. The guard follows a script's hand-offs and
  reads argv-form invocations, because the original cargo call was in neither
  the step nor the shell script it named, and it carries a test proving it
  still catches that founding case.

- `static.guest-agents` claims the Docker daemon. `capsem-builder agent`
  cross-compiles through `builder.docker.cross_compile_agent`, so it drives the
  daemon, and it declared no contention -- leaving the scheduler free to run it
  beside `install.materialize`, which holds the daemon exclusively. Found by
  the new graph invariant that a step needing a capability must claim it, not
  by anything failing.

### Added

- `runs schedule` also reports contention on binding steps. Slack is computed
  over edges alone, so it says how short a run could be on an unlimited
  machine; leaving contention out makes it actively misleading. Acting on its
  first finding freed `web.release-site` to start early, take the `astro_build`
  claim, and delay `web.frontend`, which is on the critical path -- the run's
  own resource-wait report caught it. Contention is now reported from measured
  `resource_ms`, above `slow_action_seconds` so a forty-millisecond queue is
  not dressed up as a finding.

- `capsem-gate runs schedule <command>` reports what a graph's shape costs: the
  binding set (nodes with no slack, whose duration is the run's duration) and
  the `FAST` steps owning a large share of the critical path. On `test-fast`
  the critical path is 3m24s and two steps are 100% of it --
  `fast.web.release-site` at 2m13s and `fast.audit.generated-settings` at 1m11s.

  `StepRow` records `dependency_ms`, which the run log measured on every run and
  `timing.measure` discarded. Ledger schema bumped to v2; older rows are dropped
  by the reader rather than breaking it.

- `tests/citadel/test_work_graph_invariants.py` asserts the plan's properties
  against the graph rather than against text: no orphans, every node declared,
  a step that escapes the sandbox declares `NETWORK`, a capability implies a
  claim, publishing is terminal, and no edge crosses two concrete
  architectures. These hold under any rename, reformat or move of code between
  modules, because none of those change the graph.

- Edges declare why they exist. `Requires.ARTIFACT` hands over bytes, `ORDER`
  only sequences, `EVIDENCE` needs a recorded result -- carried on
  `Plan.add(requires=...)` and exposed through `Plan.requires_of`. The
  distinction is not decoration: hermeticity contaminates along `ARTIFACT`
  edges and not along `ORDER` ones, and a redundant `ORDER` edge is lost
  parallelism where a redundant `ARTIFACT` edge usually just restates a real
  need.

- `workgraph.py` holds the gate's work as a typed DAG, with the contention
  relation kept separate because it is symmetric and non-transitive. Its first
  run over the real candidate plan found five redundant edges -- nothing in the
  tree computed a transitive reduction before -- and `from_plan` reproduces
  `Plan.edges` exactly.

- Steps declare what they are. `Kind`, `Needs`, `Arch`, `Speed` and
  `concurrency` on `execution.Step` make the plan a graph that can be reasoned
  about instead of a set of labels that has to be grepped -- a lint is a lint
  because it says so, not because a contract matched `fast.` against its name.
  Hermeticity is derived from `Needs`, never declared, so a step cannot claim a
  property its inputs contradict.

  `Speed` is relative to the work its lane protects, not an absolute duration.
  The fast phase runs about four minutes so a lint error fails before a
  candidate that runs about a hundred and forty; a two-minute step inside it is
  a three percent tax on catching a typo early, which is the trade the phase
  exists to make.

  `[boundary.step_attributes]` is a migration ledger with a destination rather
  than an exemption list: 100 call sites remain, the count may only fall, and
  when it reaches zero the defaults come off `Step` and the arguments become
  required. `tests/citadel/test_step_attributes.py` refuses both a module
  gaining undeclared steps and a ledger entry drifting above the tree.

### Fixed

- A VM no longer dies when a host client resets many published connections
  at once. Shutting down a Virtualization.framework VSOCK descriptor while
  the guest was still sending made the framework stop the whole VM with an
  internal error; the confined router now closes such a descriptor without
  shutting it down. When the framework does stop a VM, the owner records the
  framework's reason, exits, and the service reports the VM as stopped
  instead of running until every exec has timed out.
- `clippy::cast_lossless` is denied, with its 116 sites converted. It is the
  one member of the numeric-cast family that cannot be wrong -- it flags
  `x as u64` where `u64::from(x)` is infallible -- so every fix is mechanical
  and behaviour-preserving. Its three siblings (truncation, sign loss,
  wrapping) are 607 sites that each need a judgement about range, and are being
  taken a crate at a time rather than in a sweep.

- Nine I/O buffers moved off the stack, and `clippy::large_stack_arrays` is
  denied. Three were a megabyte each -- half the 2 MB a spawned thread gets by
  default, in a single frame -- and two of those are on the self-update path,
  which runs on a user's machine rather than in CI. Sizes are unchanged, so the
  I/O behaves identically; each buffer was already allocated once outside its
  loop, so this is one heap allocation per file against reading the whole file.
  Audited before the lint was enabled, so it arrives with no `allow`s.
- The `duplicate-content` filesystem rule no longer reports Tauri's generated
  schemas, which are byte-identical on Linux and neither ours to produce nor to
  deduplicate. Every fast-lane run reported one filesystem fault, and a fault
  count that is never zero is a fault count nobody reads. Exempted by an exact,
  config-owned list of trees rather than a blanket pass for generated files --
  the rule earns its place in build output too, where it caught a package lane
  copying a hardlinked alias tree into distinct inodes. The exemption matches
  path components, so `crates/capsem-app/gen` cannot also silence
  `crates/capsem-app/generated-elsewhere`.

- `filesystem.copy_tree` never dereferences a symlink. It took a `symlinks=`
  argument defaulting to false that the only informed caller overrode, to stop
  `assets/current` being materialized into a multi-gigabyte copy. A default
  every knowledgeable caller has to correct is a trap for the next one, so
  there is no argument now.

- The gate runs from a linked worktree. Its private copy now clones the
  repository instead of carrying `.git` as a path, which only worked when
  `.git` was a directory: in a worktree it is a file holding an absolute
  `gitdir:` pointer, so the copy stayed attached to the original's HEAD and the
  case was refused outright. That made the isolation machinery unusable from a
  worktree, which is how an agent gets an isolated tree in the first place --
  an agent could not verify its own work without running in the shared
  checkout.

  On one filesystem the clone costs about 200ms against a 108 MB `.git` because
  `--local` hardlinks the object store. Cross-filesystem inspection checkouts
  use `--no-local` and copy the objects without network access instead of
  failing with `Invalid cross-device link`. Neither mode creates an
  `alternates` file, so a `gc` in the original cannot prune bytes out from
  under a running gate, and the copy owns its HEAD and refs -- the property the
  refusal was protecting. Normal checkouts and worktrees now take one path with
  no special case, and `.git` left `[prefix].carried` entirely.

- The KVM CPUID ioctl buffers derive their allocation alignment from the types
  they are reinterpreted as, instead of a hardcoded `8`. The constant was
  correct only by coincidence -- `KvmCpuidEntry2` is all `u32` -- and a field
  with a wider alignment would have left every entry the kernel writes back
  undefined to read, with nothing failing, because allocators generally return
  more alignment than asked for. A compile-time assertion now holds the header
  offset that keeps the entry array aligned, and the `kvm_run` mmap base is
  asserted page-aligned where it is created rather than assumed at each of the
  six accessors that depend on it.

### Changed

- The CI branch-protection gate and the rootfs dependency setup left the two
  places they were unreadable from. `ci.yaml:pr-gate` -- the single required
  status deciding whether a PR can merge -- became
  `build_system/scripts/ci/require-ci-jobs.sh`, and `test_workflow_enforcement.py` now follows
  a dispatch into `build_system/scripts/ci/` so it still analyses the shell that decides. Two
  holes surfaced while proving that: a dispatch line mentions no job result, so
  `bash gate.sh || true` was not recognised as deciding the gate; and a result
  compared only against `skipped` on the web-only branch satisfied "every
  declared result is tested" while its failure blocked nothing. Both are now
  guarded, and the oversized-body inventory is down from 18 to 14.

- `[[lint_surfaces]]` gained `checked_by`, so the inventory covers checks that
  cannot run early instead of only lints that can. The Rust surface previously
  recorded `fast.clippy` alone -- it mapped which files were *linted* and said
  nothing about which were *tested*, while the two runners were proven by a
  separate hardcoded list in a guard. One map now, read by both guards.

- `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are symlinks to `AGENTS.md`, which is now the one
  agent contract. They were three files whose section lists had drifted almost
  disjoint: Claude was never told about the bounded-diagnostics wrapper, the
  serialized release contract or the logger DB boundary, and Codex was never
  told the code style, the invariants, or that Rust tests live in a sibling
  `tests.rs`. Nobody chose that -- no reader ever saw two of the files at once.
  `tests/citadel/test_agent_contract_is_one_file.py` refuses a copy, in the
  working tree and in the Git index, since a blob-mode file arrives as a
  divergent copy in every fresh clone.

  Two rules were softened to match practice while merging. The changelog rule
  now applies to user-visible changes rather than every commit, which 39 of the
  last 100 did not do; and the conventional-subject list names the ten types
  actually in use rather than four. A rule nobody follows teaches that the
  neighbouring rules are advisory, and the neighbours here are the DB boundary
  and the release contract.

- The docs-site smoke check moved out of `docs.yaml` into
  `build_system/scripts/web/smoke-docs-site.sh`. Twenty-three executable lines of YAML holding a
  retry loop and a thirteen-term conjunction, reachable by no linter and
  callable by nothing; ShellCheck now reads it like any other script. The
  conjunction is split into two named checks, because after a deploy the useful
  question is which condition failed rather than that one of thirteen did.

- `clippy::cast_ptr_alignment` is denied workspace-wide, after auditing its
  eleven sites rather than before. All eleven are in the KVM ioctl path and
  reduce to two patterns, both now resting on a checked invariant instead of an
  assumption; each carries the finding at the call site. Enabling it earlier
  would have meant eleven un-reviewed `allow`s, and an un-reviewed allow reads
  as reviewed -- strictly worse than the lint being off.

- Eight `clippy::pedantic` lints are denied workspace-wide, chosen from a
  measurement rather than a group: the full group is 7,448 warnings across 74
  lints here, over 2,600 of them doc and must-use style, and adopting it
  wholesale would be a rewrite mandate. The eight describe ways this code can be
  *wrong* rather than untidy, and enabling them found three real defects --
  `Writer::write_checked` documented as yielding for backpressure when its body
  is wholly synchronous and cannot, a `BTreeMap<_, ()>` used as a set in the
  profile contract, and an unchecked `Duration` subtraction that panics on a
  backwards clock.

  `unused_async`, `cast_ptr_alignment` and `large_stack_arrays` were each
  enabled, measured and backed out with the reason recorded in `Cargo.toml`.
  The pointer and stack ones are the most valuable of the three, which is
  exactly why they are not being cleared with twenty un-reviewed `allow`s: every
  alignment site is a KVM ioctl buffer whose guarantee needs auditing, and an
  un-reviewed allow reads as reviewed.

- Rust tests run under Nextest, and doctests now run at all. The `ci` profile in
  `.config/nextest.toml` -- `slow-timeout` of 120s, three retries -- was written
  and never selected, so a hung test hung the whole gate until the
  7200-second lock timeout; runs have died past the two-hour mark. Measured at
  99s against 115s for the plain runner on a warm workspace, with line coverage
  65.11% against 65.13%; the 23-line difference is process-per-test isolation
  rather than a selector mismatch, and both clear the 63% floor by two points.

  `cargo test --doc` lands in the same change because it has to: `rustinventory`
  models doctests as a separate target set precisely because "Nextest never owns
  doctests", so swapping the runner alone would have silently stopped running
  them -- a faster gate proving less, with nothing reporting the difference.
  `tests/citadel/test_rust_check_coverage.py` now holds the three-way division
  between clippy, Nextest and `--doc` so a future gap has to be deliberate.

### Fixed

- Exporting a run out of its private checkout no longer destroys an unrelated
  run's log. `target/gate-runs/latest` is a symlink to the newest run, on the
  host and inside the prefix alike, and
  `shutil.copytree(..., dirs_exist_ok=True)` dereferenced the source link and
  then wrote the contents *through* the destination link, replacing every file
  in whatever older run it pointed at. Because `copytree` copies with `copy2`,
  the clobbered run kept the source's timestamps as well -- a well-formed log
  describing a run that never happened in it, which `source.verify` and the
  timing ratchet both read as evidence. It had already happened twice.

  `filesystem.merge_tree` now replaces a destination symlink instead of writing
  through it, refuses a source-root symlink, and recreates nested source
  symlinks as symlinks, keeping the
  interruptible per-file copy. `prefix.export` and `fileactions.CopyTree` share
  it; the latter carried the identical latent defect.
  `tests/citadel/test_tree_copy_boundary.py` keeps `shutil.copytree` inside the
  one module that owns the decision.

### Added

- Gate history now outlives its run directories. `target/gate-runs/ledger.jsonl`
  keeps one distilled row per finished run -- identity, plan-shape digest, and
  every step's duration and status -- so the longitudinal questions survive a
  `keep_runs` of twenty. `capsem-gate runs digest` renders the cross-run state
  with advice attached, `runs trend --step <label>` follows one step run by run,
  and `fast.digest` rebuilds the digest at the start of the fast phase so it is
  readable while the run it precedes is still going. A session-start hook prints
  it to agents, and `tests/citadel/test_run_digest_echo.py` fails if any part of
  that wiring is removed.

  Durations are compared only under `runledger.identity` -- the same
  comparability rule the release ratchet uses, now defined once rather than
  spelled out twice. Failure counts deliberately are not: a step that keeps
  failing is worth naming whatever command ran it. Steps that were skipped or
  carried are excluded from every median, and an empty baseline reports that
  nothing was compared rather than that nothing was wrong.

### Changed

- Release qualification now selects one explicit full commit already on
  `main`, materializes it in a detached full-SHA prefix, and carries that same
  identity through run evidence, workflow dispatch, every checkout, and the
  package/profile manifest rows it authored. The outer checkout may continue
  moving while qualification runs; release commands no longer edit or push
  tracked source after the proof.

- Profile rootfs dependencies are now closed over exact per-architecture Node,
  uv, Claude, and Ollama bytes plus checked-in Python hash locks and npm
  integrity locks. Rootfs construction no longer invokes floating installer,
  upgrade, or global-package rails for those tools.

- Kernel and rootfs asset construction now exposes one resumable dependency
  frontier shared by the complete local gate and manual asset CI. It
  materializes snapshot-selected packages, verified kernel input, and
  profile-owned third-party tools into input-keyed per-architecture helpers;
  the publishable source builds consume only the helpers' exact image IDs with
  BuildKit networking and remote cache disabled.

- Every Docker build and container boundary now requires a typed network-mode
  enum. BuildKit and runtime vocabularies are distinct, raw strings are
  rejected before command execution, and config deserializes directly into
  phase-specific closed values. A missing or misplaced network policy can no
  longer silently inherit Docker's ambient default.

- Cold static qualification now routes only exact Docker dependency
  materializers through the authenticated pre-sandbox capability. Host,
  install, and guest Rust helpers are available before their sealed consumers;
  source builds and runtime remain network-denied. Guest helper probes also
  use Docker's portable formatted identity instead of the version-specific
  `image inspect --platform` flag used neither by hosted Docker nor Colima.

- Daily nightly release runners now execute the canonical Linux bootstrap
  before enforced qualification. The bootstrap may repair only GitHub's known
  hosted-runner AppArmor restriction, then must prove the complete Bubblewrap
  boundary; unknown or unhosted failures remain fatal.

- Linux and macOS build rails now share exact config-owned Rust, uv, pnpm, and
  Cargo-tool authorities. The network-open host-builder materializer is keyed
  by those values plus its immutable Ubuntu snapshot and source inputs; a warm
  match is reused, while package and install work stays network-denied. A
  focused recorded `capsem-gate host-image` rail proves cold/warm behavior
  without continuing into an unrelated package build.

- Every recorded gate command now prints its critical-path timing summary;
  nobody has to remember `--timing` before starting a multi-hour proof.
  Complete qualification also fails when its critical path or any of the prior
  comparable run's ten slowest steps grows beyond the config-owned relative
  factor. The baseline is the latest successful journal with the same typed
  plan shape, invocation, platform, machine, and core count, so no duration is
  guessed or hardcoded and a graph/host change seeds a new baseline.
- Source-size rules are one guard in the Citadel rather than one per tree.
  `[boundary.scripts]` and `[boundary.rust]` are the same rule -- roots,
  suffixes, a ceiling, an exact debt inventory -- asked of two trees, and two
  implementations of one rule is how they drift. `tests/test_script_size_contract.py`
  is retired into `tests/citadel/test_shape_boundaries.py`, which owns every
  declared family and gained the negative tests the old one lacked: a growing
  file and a new file over the ceiling each prove the ratchet fires.
- The shared Citadel lint harness now fails closed when a tool exits
  abnormally or claims findings its adapter cannot parse, and gives every
  extracted source an indexed staging name so sanitization cannot silently
  collapse two inputs into one. Both failure modes have adversarial guards.
- Citadel lint coverage now declares the existing fast YAML, JSON, and TOML
  syntax proof alongside Python, Rust, shell, Dockerfile, Markdown, web, and
  skill surfaces. The shell tokenizer's grammar and whole-repository corpus
  proof moved into Citadel too, so the guard infrastructure is tested in the
  same five-second phase that consumes it.
- The public fast-test path now enters the timed fast graph before the
  eight-minute release-contract suite, so Citadel, syntax, Ruff, Ty, Clippy,
  and audit failures answer before expensive contract rendering. A scheduling
  guard holds that user-visible order as well as the internal graph edge.
- Profile dependency lockfiles now remain first-class typed release-graph
  config artifacts. The Rust enum, generated manifest, public renderer,
  readiness validator, and stable/nightly fixture use the same
  `python_requirements_lock` and `npm_package_lock` vocabulary; a profile can
  no longer publish the locks while silently omitting them from its public
  graph.
- Rust files have a ceiling for the first time, at 1000 lines, chosen from
  Rust's own distribution rather than borrowed from Python. Rust's median
  tracked file is 232 lines, so a 300-line ceiling would flag 169 of 388 files
  -- a rewrite mandate that would be deleted the first time it blocked someone.
  1000 sits just under p90 and flags 58. Rolled out by scope one crate at a
  time, starting with `capsem-service`: two entries freeze the two largest
  files in the repository, 25,798 lines between them, in the crate CLAUDE.md
  calls a thin shell.
- The Citadel now runs in the fast phase instead of the broad suite. Its guards
  are source-level -- no artifact, no VM, no daemon, seconds rather than
  minutes -- and were reachable only through the broad suite's `root`, which carries
  `require_artifacts` and runs after the whole asset build. A DB-boundary
  violation was therefore reported once the VMs were already up, roughly forty
  minutes after the source that caused it was read, which is exactly what a
  guard written to "fail before it can ship green" must not do. `tests/citadel`
  joins `broad_ignores` so the suite has one owner rather than two, and
  `tests/citadel/test_guard_scheduling.py` fails if it is ever moved back
  behind the expensive work.
- The gate's fail-open guard is stated as a whitelist, because the blacklist
  lost. `masks_failure` enumerated ways to neutralise an enforcement check, and
  an adversarial pass walked five past it: `; :`, a trailing `&`, `| cat`,
  `set +ex`, and `set +o errexit` -- each leaving the literal a substring
  contract greps for perfectly intact. `is_bare_command` inverts the rule: an
  enforcement comparison must be the whole command, so any token that could
  consume its exit status fails, predicted or not. `disables_fail_fast` now
  matches any `set` with a `+` option rather than exactly `set +e`. All
  fourteen evasions ship as parametrized cases in the citadel guard, alongside
  four legitimate shapes that must stay green.
- The workflow shell tokenizer scans characters instead of lines, and its
  grammar is written down. `shlex` was applied per physical line, which is
  wrong because a shell word may contain a newline: four of the 184 `run:`
  steps -- all in release.yaml, including verify-release-candidate and
  verify-release-downloads -- raised `ValueError: No closing quotation`.
  Accumulating lines until the quotes balanced was tried and is worse: it stops
  the crash without parsing anything, returning a blob that looks like
  analysis. `tests/helpers/shelltokens.py` states the subset as a grammar and
  scans it, so a newline inside a quotation is part of the word by
  construction. It also fixes redirections -- `2>&1` was three tokens, read as
  a background `&`. Validated across 236 scripts (every `run:` step plus 6,991
  lines of tracked shell) with zero unreadable and identical fail-open verdicts
  wherever the old lexer could read at all. Pointing it at Dockerfile `RUN`
  bodies then found a third bug: `$( )` is its own quoting context, and the
  scanner was closing an outer double quote on the first quote inside a sed
  script. The corpus now covers all three shell surfaces -- 321 sources --
  and each found a bug the others did not. An unterminated quote raises
  `UnterminatedQuote` rather than returning nothing, so a caller cannot read
  "could not be read" as "nothing to see".
- ShellCheck now runs on every surface that carries shell, each failing closed:
  47 tracked `*.sh`, all 189 workflow `run:` bodies, and 85 Dockerfile `RUN`
  bodies including the `.j2` templates rendered through the same
  `render_dockerfile` the image build uses. Linting one of three surfaces is a
  sampling, and the two that were unchecked are where the release logic lives.
  It found two real defects in the kernel template -- an unquoted
  `make -j$(nproc)` and a `for cmd in modprobe` loop over a single item -- both
  fixed. `[boundary.shell_bodies]` then holds the line at 20 executable lines
  per body, median being 3, so the next unwieldy program goes into its owner
  under `build_system/scripts/`
  where a test can call it.
- Shell scripts are linted. Python has Ruff and strict Ty, Rust has Clippy with
  `warnings = "deny"`, the web surfaces fail on warnings -- and 6,991 lines of
  shell across 47 tracked scripts had nothing, while four
  `# shellcheck disable=` directives already sat in the tree, written for a
  linter no lane ran. `fast.audit.shell` runs ShellCheck at warning severity
  over `git ls-files -- '*.sh'`, the same tracked-file rule the script size
  ratchet uses. It found no real defects: the only two hits were a deliberate
  `CDPATH= cd` and a sourced library with no shebang, both now carrying a
  directive that records why. ShellCheck arrives through `shellcheck-py` in
  `uv.lock`, so it needs no new bootstrap step.
- Skill frontmatter descriptions are halved, from 11,162 characters to 5,158.
  They are loaded into every agent session before any work starts and are the
  text a router picks from, so length is not neutral: thirty-four paragraphs
  discriminate worse than thirty-four sentences. The bloat was uniform rather
  than a few offenders -- median 320 characters, all 34 above 150 -- because
  each ended with a "Covers X, Y, Z" enumeration restating its own body.
  Removing that one habit did most of the work; median is now 153 and nothing
  exceeds 200. Disambiguation was kept where two skills genuinely collide, such
  as dev-start pointing at dev-setup. `tests/citadel/test_skill_context_budget.py`
  holds the ceiling, and also holds a floor, since a budget alone is satisfiable
  by deleting the text. Bodies were already healthy and only gained a ceiling to
  stop regrowth.
- Every Citadel guard now states its reasoning in the failure message rather
  than only in a docstring. `test_package_architecture_boundary.py` had neither
  a docstring nor a rationale, and its checks were bare asserts -- a failing
  `assert "fn deb_graph_arch" not in updater` said nothing about why that
  bridge between `PackageArchitecture` (amd64) and `Architecture` (x86_64) is
  forbidden. It now collects named violations with reasons in the style
  `test_db_boundary.py` established, behind
  `ARCHITECTURE_DOMAIN_RATIONALE`.

### Changed

- Guest binaries for a foreign architecture are cross-compiled instead of
  emulated. The builder image is now resolved from the *host* rather than the
  target: it is always the host platform's exact `rust:1.97.1-alpine3.23`
  child, and a foreign target is reached by materializing that target plus an
  exact config-pinned `clang` package into the image at build time, on the same
  network-open setup edge `cargo fetch --locked` already uses. Rust's pinned
  toolchain supplies `rust-lld`. Measured cold on a 16-core Linux
  host for the six aarch64 guest binaries, through the real build path:
  **1194.7s emulated against 89s cross**, with a 44s image build. A profile
  release run compiles that graph three times, so this is roughly forty
  minutes per run. The change is symmetric and fixes macOS too, where it is the
  x86_64 lane that was emulated on Apple Silicon.

  `ring` is the only crate in the `capsem-agent` + `capsem-bench` graph that
  compiles C, and Alpine's clang cross-compiles it for a foreign musl target
  with no external sysroot -- which is what makes this available at all. The
  runtime build is unchanged in every other respect: `--network none`,
  `--locked --offline`, guest binaries still `chmod 555`. Cross-built binaries
  were verified to execute under aarch64 and to be byte-identical across
  independent builds. The image tag is now keyed by the resolved base,
  platform and cross shape, so a native helper and a cross one can never share
  a tag.

### Fixed

- Sealed rootfs dependency materialization now preserves the exact base image's
  runtime Debian source, rewrites it to HTTPS, and restores it after snapshot
  package acquisition so the booted guest retains a usable apt authority.

- The private image-build backend's typed dependency-helper contract now runs
  in the fast source module. Test fixtures can no longer return a legacy raw
  image-ID string and postpone that interface failure until hosted macOS CI.
- Rootfs publication now fails closed while removing setuid and setgid bits.
  The sealed build propagates traversal and `chmod` failures, independently
  verifies that no privileged file remains, and the in-guest acceptance scan
  likewise refuses filesystem errors instead of treating them as an empty
  result.
- Hosted install qualification now exports bounded glow-up JSON through a
  dedicated host mount and uploads it with the exact gate journal; a missing
  failure artifact is fatal instead of a warning.
- Installed-package glow-up now imports immutable selected profiles with the
  typed legacy-revision compatibility policy while keeping all new public
  profile authoring on strict SemVer.
- Diagnostic continuation now re-records source identity after refreshing a
  retained prefix while carrying only steps whose typed resume policy permits
  reuse. The final source guard can no longer spend hours testing the refreshed
  revision and then compare it with the previous run's stale receipt.
- Binary-only update fixtures now preserve the selected profiles' compatibility
  bounds unless the fixture explicitly declares an asset compatibility change.
  Hosted install checks can no longer manufacture a profile update while
  exercising an unrelated package transition.
- Standalone static qualification now materializes its own Node workspace,
  generated settings, and Tauri frontend bundle before Rust coverage. A fresh
  private checkout no longer depends on `web/app/dist` produced in another
  gate command's discarded prefix.
- A focused gate command given an existing `--prefix` now actually executes
  inside that retained checkout. Cross-compile and other diagnostic rails can
  no longer accept the shared option while writing their artifacts and run
  journal into the source checkout instead.
- Release-graph profile materialization now preserves every supported evidence
  artifact in the paired runtime manifest. In particular, a verified published
  software inventory can no longer be staged on disk and then silently lose
  its manifest identity before sealed install qualification authors its local
  graph.
- Sealed install qualification can now import the path-safe legacy revision
  carried by already-published immutable profiles without weakening SemVer for
  any new first-party or corporate profile. A new SemVer revision may migrate
  from that historical format once; new legacy revisions remain refused.
- Cross-package dependency helpers now keep config-owned host tools pinned to
  the builder architecture while APT resolves foreign development libraries.
  Ubuntu can no longer replace the Python/uv driver with a foreign interpreter
  or fail the sealed arm64 package materializer on that conflict.
- Checked-in storage release callers are now validated against the
  config-owned phase inventory in the fast source gate. Retired release
  phases can no longer survive as dormant Just commands or fail only after
  the complete fast module has passed in hosted CI.
- Install and package dependency helpers now disable Rustup auto-install before
  verifying the config-pinned toolchain and inspect only the local installed
  inventory. A verification probe can no longer become a mutable channel-sync
  edge during hosted qualification.
- Release-proof fixtures now materialize the exact config-owned boot and
  evidence artifact inventory for every selected architecture. The fast gate
  therefore keeps exercising install and deb-proof behavior after
  `ProfileContent` rejects incomplete cohorts, without weakening that refusal.
- Hosted install qualification now stages the complete config-owned evidence
  closure for every selected profile architecture, including OBOM and software
  inventory aliases plus their immutable hash names. `ProfileContent` refuses
  an incomplete cohort before package Docker work, so release pairing cannot
  discover missing evidence only after building the package and install image.
- The stop-before-service contract now recognizes the shared client's typed
  constructor instead of pinning one obsolete constructor method name. The
  guard continues to require `capsem stop` to return before shared service,
  status, profile, or credential hydration.
- Selected install qualification now keeps the fetched release graph intact
  and relies on its twice-executed immutable input report for local byte
  binding. Hosted stable/nightly manifests are no longer mistaken for a
  missing offline transport merely because their authoritative URLs remain
  public while a separate runtime projection is staged locally.
- Successful focused continuations now retain an explicitly reused private
  prefix after exporting their evidence. A diagnostic `--prefix/--from` slice
  can no longer delete the exact candidate workspace needed by the next
  continuation; fresh successful qualification still reclaims its own copy.
- One-shot `capsem run` now gives any directly spawned fallback service a
  typed command-bound lifetime. After the complete `/run` response, the CLI
  terminates and reaps only the service it spawned and removes its owned
  socket; the parent watcher remains the crash fallback. This prevents both
  hidden descendants and a consecutive command connecting to a dying stale
  socket, while ordinary installed and interactive services stay persistent.
- Docker contract recorders now answer the same portable platform-and-image-ID
  probe as the production gate, so hosted-CLI compatibility changes cannot
  leave broad qualification fixtures asserting against an obsolete inspect
  shape. Synthetic macOS plans also declare the supported Apple Silicon host
  instead of inheriting the Linux test machine architecture.
- IronBank asset boot proofs now launch their selected-content service through
  the gate's detached process primitive, persist its configured PID, and wait
  for its socket before entering the foreground shell. A successful proof can
  no longer leave an auto-started descendant behind or bypass orphan-process
  accounting.
- Asset resume now treats the final manifest as the producer completion
  record: every boot and evidence file must match its recorded size and BLAKE3
  digest. Profile producers are ordered and invalidate that record before
  starting, so non-empty output from a failed build can never turn a resumed
  qualification green.
- Sealed asset scanners now return generated OBOM files to the invoking host
  owner before deterministic normalization, so rootless qualification can
  finish without weakening the scanner container or its network denial.
- macOS CI records and uploads its partial Python cohorts without pretending
  they are the whole source suite. The complete gate's broad all-source cohort
  remains the sole owner of the positive, config-owned coverage floor.
- Release-selected profile inputs now retain their immutable release graph in
  the paired `inputs/` transport while atomically finalizing one byte-identical
  legacy runtime projection under both `assets/` and `config/`. Package and
  install rails therefore cannot mix manifest representations or stale cohorts.
- Architecture-swappable Linux development packages are now a validated subset
  of the config-owned native package inventory and are passed into the sealed
  helper explicitly. Contract tests follow that semantic authority and Docker
  command ordering instead of depending on whitespace in a Dockerfile.
- Linux bootstrap, hosted ARM coverage, hosted static checks, and the sealed
  host builder now consume one config-owned native dependency inventory and
  prove its pkg-config modules before compiling. A missing GTK/glib package
  therefore fails during provisioning instead of one minute into Clippy.

- Linux bootstrap and hosted fast CI now run the same config-owned Bubblewrap
  kernel proof before qualification. The ephemeral Ubuntu runner may repair
  only its exact AppArmor user-namespace failure, then must still prove a
  loopback-only namespace, working loopback/devices, and denied direct egress.

- macOS CI now keeps Rust target selectors on the Nextest execution command;
  its coverage-report command receives only report-compatible arguments, so a
  fully passing Rust cohort cannot be turned red after execution.

- Legacy published profiles whose root bytes are selected by a nested root
  manifest now rehydrate only byte-for-byte verified checkout cache hits. This
  keeps current manifests fully self-contained while allowing install CI to
  pair a new binary with the existing stable profile graph.

- Workflow provisioning contracts now follow Just reachability for `uv` as
  well as Node tools, so every Linux lane installs the exact gate interpreter
  before invoking `capsem-gate`.

- Diagnostic continuation now validates carried Docker authorities before any
  resumed work. If storage reclamation removed an exact helper image, the gate
  refuses immediately and names its owning `--from` step instead of rebuilding
  kernels or profiles before failing at the first hidden consumer. Producers
  now declare their real artifact consumers separately from mere ordering, so
  bounded cleanup may reclaim the working host-builder after every package and
  install helper has consumed it without invalidating a later exact-source
  resume whose remaining work cannot use that image.

- The snapshot-pinned asset-tools image now proves `mkfs.erofs` through its
  portable help contract instead of the unsupported `-V` flag used by Debian's
  erofs-utils 1.5. Required helper bases also carry narrow first-line BuildKit
  waivers while remaining argument-only, so warning cleanup cannot introduce a
  mutable fallback image.

- Synthetic real-runner tests now receive the same config-owned cancellation
  policy as the complete gate instead of trying to discover a second gate
  configuration inside their minimal Git fixtures. The exact Ty debt ratchet
  also records the newly reduced diagnostic count rather than treating an
  improvement as an unexplained source-contract failure.

- Interrupting a gate now terminates the exact foreground process tree it
  owns, including descendants moved into a Bubblewrap session, before releasing
  the workspace lock. The grace and cancellation polling bounds are config-owned;
  unrelated developer processes are never selected by name or touched.

- The sealed install-image smoke no longer requires the asset-only CycloneDX
  generator from the host builder. The digest-verified asset-tools helper is
  again the single owner, so install qualification cannot fail on a tool its
  domain neither installs nor uses.

- CI and release workflow enforcement is now a structurally parsed fast-gate
  inventory instead of a spelling-sensitive grep. All 12 `just` edges reject
  skipped jobs/steps, ignored failures, shell masks, missing commands, and
  unclassified additions; equivalent YAML/shell presentation remains valid.
  Its mutation fixtures now transform parsed workflow documents too, so a
  harmless YAML reformat cannot prevent the intended broken edit from being
  applied and turn the guard itself into a false failure.
  The guard also exposed and fixed a Rust coverage pipeline that could lose
  `cargo llvm-cov report`'s failure status through `tee`.

- VM asset builds now inventory every mutable package/fetch tool in an
  executable fast-gate guardrail. Guest Rust always compiles through its
  locked, network-denied architecture helper; EROFS and CycloneDX run from one
  snapshot- and digest-keyed host helper with networking disabled. The profile
  release workflow no longer installs parallel musl or npm cdxgen authorities.

- The guest Rust builder's `/src/*` workspace glob is now documented and
  guarded as load-bearing rather than left looking like an oversight. It skips
  dotfiles, so `.cargo/config.toml` never reaches `/build` and no container
  build applies the checked-in Cargo configuration -- which reads like a bug
  and is not one. That file sets `linker = "rust-lld"` for
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`; inside the Alpine builder that triple is the
  *host* target, so inheriting it makes every proc-macro (`serde_derive`,
  `tokio-macros`) link its host `.so` with rust-lld and fail on
  `unable to find library -lgcc_s`. Widening the glob was tried and breaks the
  build. `test_container_workspace_excludes_dotfiles` now fails if it is
  widened again, and `/build-images` records the rule: checked-in Cargo
  configuration is developer-host configuration, and the builder container
  receives its toolchain settings as environment.
- The complete gate now runs its cheap source checks before the nine-minute
  release contract suite instead of after it. The two phases were already
  serial, so the order cost nothing in total time and everything in how long a
  trivial failure took to surface: two consecutive `release-profile` attempts
  died at 9m12 and 11m39 on a single unused local variable that `ruff` reports
  in under two seconds. Ruff and both Ty passes now answer at wave five rather
  than behind `contracts.release`.
- `pr-gate` enforcement is now proved structurally rather than by substring.
  The literal-text contract was inverted in both directions: reformatting
  `needs:` into YAML block style or reordering it -- neither of which GitHub
  can distinguish from the original -- turned four contracts red, while
  appending `|| true` to every enforcement line or adding
  `continue-on-error: true` to the deciding step left all twenty-four
  assertions green with merge protection fully disabled.
  `tests/test_ci_enforcement_contract.py` reads the parsed workflow, checks the
  properties no substring can see, and keeps all four mutations as executable
  cases so a regression to text matching fails there.
- `_workflow_job_block` locates a job through the parsed document instead of
  slicing on exact two-space indentation. The old slice lost the job outright
  after a reindent and truncated the block at any comment at that indentation
  ending in `:`, silently dropping every step below it from the assertions that
  followed. The required pr-gate job list is now one set constant rather than
  the same exact string restated in four contracts.
- EROFS rootfs publication now accepts only the release-owned `lz4` and
  `lz4hc` formats. The unused experimental zstd rail and its mutable
  `debian:trixie-slim` helper selection have been removed before the 0.6 cut.

- The web-only CI isolation contract no longer leaves a dead whole-workflow
  read beside its exact job-block assertions, keeping the complete release
  fast phase clean under Ruff after the documentation holding merge.

- Binary release validation, the documentation holding-artifact verifier, and
  its contracts now consume one typed config-owned release line. Merging the
  pre-release holding site can no longer make the complete release gate fail
  because a Python verifier restated the line it was supposed to check.

- Linux sealed-install qualification now prefetches the locked Cargo graph and
  compiles one current-source CLI while building the network-denied source
  image. Update and channel-transition tests consume that exact executable
  instead of attempting Cargo or Rustup repair inside the privileged,
  network-disabled package runtime.

- The generated checkout-root asset selector is now explicitly ignored as
  build output, matching the Docker context that already excludes asset trees.
  Creating the selector after asset qualification can no longer change the
  source digest and make final install proof request a different exact sealed
  image from the one the same gate built and smoked.

- Retained-prefix continuation no longer carries a source-keyed install image
  merely because functional VM work resumes. The image lifecycle runs as an
  independent branch and remains a hard prerequisite of exact install proof,
  so a refreshed source tree cannot select a tag that was never materialized.

- Gateway status now reads the independent VM and profile authorities
  concurrently while preserving fresh source data and failure semantics. This
  removes avoidable control-route latency without weakening the release budget.

- Rust dependencies now require the panic-safe `lru` 0.18.2 line directly and
  through Ratatui 0.30.2, removing both versions covered by
  `RUSTSEC-2026-0253` without weakening the strict advisory gate.

- Linux exact-install containers now map the host's numeric KVM/vhost-vsock
  device group onto the unprivileged installed user before systemd starts.
  Preflight probes run as that same user, so Doctor cannot reach its first VM
  boot with root-only device access that the gate mistakenly accepted.

- Native Linux and macOS installers now carry the exact manifest bytes selected
  by the public installer into the network-sealed postinstall, alongside their
  logical source URL. Relative assets resolve against that source without a
  second manifest fetch, package-owned stable/nightly polling provenance stays
  intact, and failed package-manager runs retain the secure paired handoff for
  retry while successful installs remove it.

- KVM warm checkpoints now discard deleted cache-only VirtioFS inode entries
  that have no live file or directory handle while preserving the monotonic
  guest inode allocator. Open-unlinked handles remain fail-closed, and a typed
  suspend-failure IPC result reports checkpoint errors distinctly from real
  45-second confirmation timeouts.

- `release-binaries` and `release-profile` now reject `--from` from their own
  publishing authority, even before a release workflow environment exists.
  Candidate retained-prefix continuation remains diagnostic-only and cannot
  become public release evidence.

- Candidate and both release commands now refuse `--sandbox off` and
  `--sandbox report` before plan construction, re-exec, resource acquisition,
  or action execution. Their shared complete-qualification declaration remains
  enforcing by default, while incomplete module commands retain explicit
  permissive modes for diagnostic sandbox measurement.

- Linux Doctor now distinguishes the machine-lock ancestry marker from the
  typed sandbox policy of its owning gate command. Enforcing candidates still
  prove a loopback-only kernel namespace, while standalone asset builds can
  retain their declared network without falsely claiming Bubblewrap escaped.

- Candidate and static qualification no longer schedule storage-release phases
  that owned no working resource. Their real capacity checks and sealed install
  lifecycle remain ordered, while CI no longer provisions an unused host pnpm
  cache for the container-owned Linux package rail.

- Checked-in first-party scripts now have a 300-line ceiling in the fast source
  contracts. The 26 larger historical scripts carry exact config-owned line
  counts that may only shrink, while Git-tracked root scoping excludes generated
  output and vendored dependencies without a silent exemption list.

- The asset-pipeline and site-architecture skill entrypoints now route
  reference-heavy manifest, publication, protocol, storage, lifecycle, crate,
  and privilege detail on demand. Their always-loaded spines shrink from
  308/362 lines to 108/85 without dropping their source-contract guidance.

- The release-process skill now keeps its command, qualification, lane,
  `ProfileContent`, platform-proof, and retry invariants in a 146-line spine
  while routing the full workflow, verification, and versioning contracts to
  explicit on-demand references, down from a 564-line always-loaded document.

- Linux package construction now materializes its target dependencies in an
  input-keyed helper from an immutable Ubuntu snapshot, locked Cargo and pnpm
  stores, and a digest-verified static ORT archive. The publishable source
  build consumes the exact helper image with networking disabled, carries one
  verified asset/config cohort through concrete real-directory mounts, and
  preserves full per-architecture gate journals in release CI without noisy
  successful dependency output on the live terminal. BuildKit and container
  network modes are now separate schema-bound values: only the dependency
  materializer receives BuildKit's ordinary network, while source construction
  and package execution remain network-denied and cross-vocabulary values are
  refused before Docker or Colima starts work. The network-open helper parent
  is bound to its exact platform-child ID; a repository digest is used when
  available, while plain local Docker/Colima images use an input-keyed tag
  checked before and after the child build. The network-denied source build
  uses the same checked local reference. Warm helpers are keyed to
  the exact host-platform child image rather than a provenance index whose
  attestation can change without changing the executable base. Cross-target
  helpers prefetch both the publishable target graph and the build-host graph,
  so host-compiled build scripts and procedural macros cannot discover a
  missing conditional crate after the package lane has sealed its network.

- Package, Debian, macOS, pulled-release, and final install proof now carry one
  typed profile-content root whose assets and materialized configuration are
  validated and mounted as a pair. Docker/Colima never receives the mutable
  checkout asset selector. Selected release profile inputs are reverified from
  their immutable transport and combined with the exact package into one
  checked local install graph, rather than rematerialized from checkout state
  or allowed to fall back to a public URL. Ordinary install CI stages the same
  manifest-selected pair before both package construction and glow-up. The
  macOS proof preserves its Tart, physical VZ, Doctor, and Winterfell coverage
  while consuming that same pair and no longer rematerializes stale checkout
  configuration.

- Linux exact-package qualification now names its dependency materializer,
  network-denied source image build, network-denied smoke, and capacity proof
  as separate gate steps. The input-keyed helper consumes the exact
  host-platform builder child, an immutable Ubuntu snapshot, locked uv and
  pnpm stores, and config-owned runtime packages; every later phase revalidates
  and runs the exact image ID with networking disabled. Selected profile bytes
  travel in a verified read-only subtree, Debian proof authors the same exact
  local package/profile graph before its one `dpkg -i`, and release runners
  prepare native package dependencies from the same snapshot without a repair
  install or mutable apt fallback. Both container proofs verify the exact
  package `Depends` tuple against that helper authority before their sole
  `dpkg -i`, and the narrow Debian proof copies its read-only profile cohort
  into writable staging before `capsem-admin` records the candidate binary.
  The helper hands its frozen pnpm store to the unprivileged build user, and
  containerd platform-child IDs remain exact evidence while the verified
  input-keyed tag supplies the portable runnable reference.

- Direct development diagnostics now have a portable bounded-process wrapper
  that closes stdin and owns the complete child process group. A blocked
  Docker client, compiler, test runner, or helper is terminated on timeout or
  interruption instead of surviving its owning agent command; complete gate
  and release runs retain their separate config-owned timeout and resume
  contracts.

- The package-lane Dockerfile now carries a narrow BuildKit waiver for its
  deliberately required base argument. The composed gate still supplies the
  exact locally materialized host-builder image, with no default or fallback,
  while clean Docker/Colima checks no longer report a misleading empty-base
  warning.

- Failed one-shot VM startup now assigns post-mortem preservation to the
  single teardown path that atomically removes the live instance. A racing
  child watcher and provisioning failure can no longer rename the same
  session twice or emit false logs-lost and orphaned-directory warnings.

- Linux KVM warm checkpoints now preserve the embedded VirtioFS inode and
  open file/directory-handle state before restoring virtqueues. Checkpoints
  carry a bounded, versioned backend payload and reject replaced paths,
  escaped or malformed state, changed share identity, and inconsistent MMIO
  topology before activation, so a resumed guest can keep using `/root` and
  descriptors opened before suspend instead of hanging on its next exec.
  Checkpoint v9 also binds each block device to its already-open backing-file
  identity and guest-visible ID, binds vhost-vsock state to the exact guest
  CID, and validates every MMIO slot, device type, feature/status bit, and
  virtqueue memory range before starting any restored backend. The
  vhost-vsock backend is stopped behind its vring barriers before RAM is
  copied, records both queue positions, and must restart successfully from
  those positions before a restored VM is allowed to run.

- Fresh bootstrap, reusable fast CI, both orthogonal release pairing jobs, and
  the Linux host-builder now provision the same exact `cargo-nextest` version.
  Config-owned Cargo tools carry executable version probes, so a warm host is
  repaired and re-verified instead of silently qualifying with a drifting
  binary; Rust inventory failures also print the hidden subprocess error.

- Fresh profile asset lanes now repack every architecture's minimal kernel
  initrd with the complete config-owned guest payload before merge, boot, or
  archive proof. The same explicit-target primitive runs in profile release CI
  after rootfs construction, then regenerates the manifest and hash aliases;
  kernel-only construction remains minimal until that rootfs step.

- Rust MITM integration coverage now routes its allowed TLS/SNI cases to a
  loopback upstream override while preserving policy, telemetry, method/path,
  and keep-alive assertions, so the complete sealed gate no longer depends on
  public DNS or `elie.net` availability.

- The Linux install-test image now inherits `uv` from its locally built host
  builder instead of resolving a redundant mutable `ghcr.io` stage from inside
  the sealed gate.

- Linux qualification now keeps the shared signing dependency nodes as honest
  no-ops instead of attempting to launch Apple's `codesign`; Darwin retains
  the complete entitlement-signing actions and artifact ownership.

- Clean qualification now derives the guest-base architecture comparison from
  authoritative config and keeps adversarial model tests out of the Python
  suppression budget, so exact source-contract ratchets remain green without
  accepting new type debt.

- Canonical Linux bootstrap now installs the distro-owned QEMU user/binfmt
  package for the host's opposite architecture, refreshes only the distro
  registration service, and proves an enabled executable interpreter with the
  fix-binary flag Docker requires. The exact arm64 preflight therefore works on
  a fresh x86_64 host without a privileged helper-image workaround, while
  macOS keeps its existing Colima Rosetta path.

- Guest kernel/rootfs builders now require distinct per-platform Debian child
  manifest digests, materialize missing exact bases through the guarded Docker
  daemon boundary before every asset rail, and use that same exact base for the
  cross-architecture execution probe. Cold arm64 runners no longer attempt to
  resolve a mutable tag from inside Bubblewrap while warm x86_64 hosts pass
  from stale cache, and the redundant constant `FROM --platform` warning is
  gone.

- Guest Rust cross-builds now derive input-keyed per-architecture helper
  images from exact `rust:1.97.1-alpine3.23` child manifests and `Cargo.lock`
  at the guarded Docker prefetch boundary. Those children already contain the
  exact toolchain, native musl target, headers, and compiler, so materializing
  the helper performs no apt or rustup installation. The actual build keeps
  the lockfile, runs Cargo `--locked --offline` with `--network none`, and no
  longer masks the baked registry/rustup state with empty anonymous volumes or
  performs live downloads during qualification.

- Guest-kernel construction now uses one exact checked-in release and SHA-256,
  verifies the downloaded source archive before extraction, and no longer
  consults the mutable kernel.org latest-patch feed from inside the sealed
  candidate gate.

- Release qualification now remains inside Linux Bubblewrap or macOS Seatbelt
  while an authenticated one-time helper serves only the three live advisory
  queries, manifest resolution, exact-main publication, and workflow dispatch.
  Direct release-CI modules enter the same boundary after locked dependencies
  and immutable inputs are materialized.

- Filesystem source mutations discovered by watchdog now cross back to the
  plan worker and fail publishing runs after durable fault/journal evidence;
  transient mutate-and-revert can no longer kill only the observer thread and
  let a release continue. Watchdog-thread events also keep concurrent steps as
  candidates instead of falsely claiming every live step wrote the path.

- Package asset selection now uses a verified relative `assets/current`
  symlink instead of copying and de-hardlinking the selected architecture tree,
  and standalone cross-compile composes the install image its exact package
  proof requires.

- Linux doctor now proves the Bubblewrap network boundary, build-chain
  contracts describe platform behavior rather than removed shell mechanisms,
  and gate/release/setup skills document the current hermetic release model.
  Bootstrap now installs all four config-owned Node workspaces through the
  gate instead of provisioning only the frontend by hand, and derives,
  installs, exposes, and verifies the exact checked-in Rust toolchain instead
  of trusting an ambient `cargo` shim or default toolchain. It also exposes
  every config-owned Cargo gate tool to subsequent hermetic processes and
  avoids re-entering the Node installer from bootstrap already owned by a
  running gate. Bootstrap and doctor now read the namespace-aware Linux
  interface ledger when recognizing that loopback-only gate instead of trying
  to nest Bubblewrap using the host-visible sysfs interface tree. Once inside,
  bootstrap verifies existing Docker, Buildx, KVM, and vhost-vsock access
  without depending on online username lookup or attempting host mutation.

- Linux Bubblewrap qualification now explicitly preserves the host device
  mount. A root bind alone exposed `/dev/null`, KVM, and vhost nodes but left
  them unusable inside the user namespace, causing pytest to fail before it
  could collect the first sandboxed suite.

- Release workflow preflight now treats absent Apple credentials and CI-owned
  SBOM tools as explicitly inapplicable on Linux while remaining fail-closed
  for macOS signing.

- Profile release dispatch now carries a unique workflow correlation identity
  and waits for that exact GitHub Actions run with failure propagation. This
  makes serialized profile-then-binary automation safe when the same channel
  already has queued release work.

### Added

- The nightly scheduler now rebuilds the `code` and `co-work` profile assets
  through their independent public commands before running the binary lane.
  Existing binary identities take a correlated rebuild-and-test path without
  overwriting immutable signed releases; stable remains manual.

- `capsem.gate.auditfs` is the one place Python may hardlink a file into
  published output, and a contract refuses a raw `os.link` anywhere else. It
  classifies the source first and fails closed -- anything git tracks, or
  anything it cannot classify, is copied. The Rust sibling of this guard exists
  because `capsem-admin` once staged 48 checked-in `config/` files into release
  artifacts one inode each, so a `chmod` on the artifact rewrote tracked source
  and no content digest noticed. Python's single hardlink happened to be safe;
  "happened to be" is not a guarantee.

- `--prefix <tree> --from <step>` continues a failed gate instead of replaying
  it. The tree is a private checkout an earlier run kept, so its `target/` is
  still warm; the step is where to start, and everything the graph puts before
  it is carried.

      capsem-gate candidate --prefix ~/.cg/a025fce7 --from artifacts.build-chain

  What gets carried comes from the graph, not from a previous run's log, so the
  answer is the same every time and checkable before anything executes --
  `--dry-run --from <step>` prints which steps would be skipped and how many
  would run. A misspelled step name costs a suggestion rather than twenty
  minutes and a held machine lock.

  A failed run now keeps its prefix for exactly this reason, and says where it
  is; a successful one still reclaims it. This closes a cost the private
  checkout introduced: a fresh copy per run starts with no `target/`, so every
  replay was cold, and six consecutive `just test` runs were spent re-proving
  the same twenty minutes to reach a failure one step further on.

  **It is an iteration tool and never a qualification.** `AGENTS.md` and
  `release-process` forbid a reduced gate, a skip flag and an environment
  bypass on the release path, and a resumed run is all three if it is allowed
  to stand in for a clean one. So it is refused outright when the run is
  proving a release, and a carried step is recorded as `carried` rather than
  `ok` -- the run log has to say which steps this process actually ran, or a
  resumed run reads back as a complete proof of the whole graph.


- `capsem.gate.prefix` builds a private per-run copy of the checkout, so a gate
  reads a tree nobody else has a path to. Every other isolation the gate has is
  a declaration checked against another declaration; this is the grant itself.
  Detection was never going to be enough -- on the run that died at
  `source.verify` after 61 minutes, the observer had already flagged the first
  intruding write at 22:15:56 and named the file at 22:21:27, 23 minutes before
  the run stopped, and the hour was lost anyway because the tree under the gate
  had moved.

  Measured against the real checkout: `~/.cg/<8hex>` is 25 characters, the copy
  takes 1.6s and 98 MB, and it produces a source digest *byte-identical* to the
  tree it came from. Editing the checkout afterwards moved the checkout's digest
  and left the copy's unchanged, which is the proof the phase exists for.

  Two things `git ls-files` cannot see are declared in `[prefix] carried`
  rather than discovered during a release. `.git`, because build provenance
  goes through `build.rs` and every source-state action shells out to git; and
  `private/`, which is gitignored and holds the Tauri signing keys -- a copy
  built from the digest set alone loses them and the package lane finds out
  mid-release. Tracked symlinks are recreated as symlinks: `git ls-files` lists
  them like files, and `cp` without `-R` follows them, which fails outright
  against `.agents/skills` and would silently duplicate a tree anywhere it
  succeeded.

  The test modules now run from one. `capsem-gate test-fast` completes green
  from `~/.cg/<8hex>` in 89s with no `target/`, and the copy is reclaimed on
  the success and failure paths alike -- with the run log, step logs, summary
  and fault log exported back to the checkout first, so a failed run's evidence
  does not die with the tree that produced it. Inspection (`--dry-run`,
  `--graph`) builds no copy: it answers before the hook, as it already did for
  the keep-awake re-exec.

- `require-source-unchanged` gained the half a private copy would otherwise
  swallow. A prefix is frozen when it is made, so its own `HEAD` and digest
  cannot change from outside, and comparing only those would pass
  unconditionally while a commit landed on the branch being qualified. The
  recorded state now carries the source checkout's `HEAD` as well. Unprefixed
  it is the same comparison twice and costs nothing; prefixed it is the only
  one that can still see the real branch move.

### Security

- Linux complete candidate gates now enter a Bubblewrap network namespace
  with loopback as the only interface, matching the direct-egress guarantee of
  the macOS Seatbelt profile while leaving Docker's AF_UNIX socket and local
  test servers usable. The wrapper is applied before the machine lock and any
  held resource. Recursion is detected from the kernel's effective interface
  set, not an environment marker an inherited shell could forge; exporting the
  existing keep-awake marker no longer bypasses the macOS sandbox either.

- `nanoid` is pinned above GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55 in all four JavaScript
  workspaces, a high-severity hang where a custom generator loops indefinitely
  when size is zero (affects < 3.3.17). All four sat on 3.3.16, one patch
  below the fix. Verified by rebuilding docs, site and release-site as well as
  re-auditing.

- `dompurify` is pinned above GHSA-55q2-fjhq-7xh7 in the docs site, a moderate
  XSS where an `IN_PLACE` hook removal leaves a detached subtree executable
  (affects <= 3.4.12). Verified by rebuilding the site as well as re-running
  the audit: a version override that satisfies the advisory and breaks the
  build is not a fix, which a `js-yaml` bump to 5.x demonstrated earlier.

- `js-yaml` is pinned to `^4.3.1` across all four pnpm workspaces, closing
  CVE-2026-59870 (quadratic CPU consumption in `!!omap` resolution, high). It
  is a transitive dependency everywhere, so the fix is a `pnpm.overrides`
  entry rather than a version bump.

  Pinned inside 4.x deliberately. `>=4.3.1` resolves to 5.2.3, which dropped
  the default export Astro imports and broke every site build — the advisory's
  fix landed in 4.3.1, so the range that admits a major version admits a
  breakage the advisory never asked for.

- `mermaid` moved to 11.16.1 in `docs`, closing five advisories: two prototype
  pollutions, a CSS injection, and two denial-of-service paths. The dependency
  already allowed the fixed version; the lockfile was holding 11.16.0.

### Changed

- `docs.capsem.org` now publishes a Capsem 0.6 pre-release holding surface while
  the complete detailed manual remains preserved in Git. The root README no
  longer advertises installation, release downloads, or deep documentation
  before the release is qualified.

- No lane mounts a named volume. Phase 9 completes literally rather than
  partially: the cargo registry, cargo git and rustup volumes are gone because
  they mounted over `/usr/local/cargo` and `/usr/local/rustup` -- exactly where
  `Dockerfile.host-builder` installs the toolchain, the cross-targets,
  tauri-cli and cargo-auditable -- so the image carried all of it and every
  container saw a stale volume instead. The per-architecture build directories
  and the
  release-site output are anonymous volumes, allocated per container and
  reclaimed with it, so nothing carries state between two gates.

- Public recipe names now come from `tests/variables.py`, which reads
  `config/public-surface.toml`, and a contract forbids spelling them as
  literals. Renaming one recipe broke five contracts in four files and not one
  of them was testing behaviour -- they asserted that a block called `smoke:`
  held certain lines in a certain order, so a rename that changed nothing
  failed the build while a behaviour change keeping the name would have
  passed. Renaming now touches the ledger, the justfile and the docs, and no
  test at all.

- Five named volumes are retired: `capsem-install-target`,
  `-frontend-dist`, `-cargo`, `-rustup` and `-frontend-node-modules`. The
  install lanes copy their source into the image now, so nothing declares
  them. The agent registry/rustup pairs are retired too now that the exact
  per-architecture builder image bakes those inputs, and build directories are
  anonymous container-local storage reclaimed with their containers.

- No gate lane mounts the checkout any more. The install image, the install
  proof container, the deb proof and the package lane all copy their source in,
  `Mount.unmigrated` is deleted along with the last caller, and the foreign-UID
  probe goes with them -- it existed to prove a non-owner could read a bind
  mount, and there is no bind mount and no discovered revision left to get
  wrong. Generated inputs the package build reads (`assets/`, 3.0 GB, and the
  materialized profile catalog) are mounted read-only through the named
  `Mount.generated`, because copying multi-gigabyte build output into a layer
  every run would be a worse trade than the mount ever was.
- `capsem-gate candidate` now runs under an enforcing sandbox that denies the
  network. Releases keep the wider profile, since their fetch and publish
  halves genuinely need it.
- A source-tree fault aborts a release instead of being logged. A developer who
  edits during a gate can read the report and judge; a run about to publish
  would otherwise ship an artifact whose provenance names a tree that did not
  hold still.

- `just smoke` is replaced by `just fast-test` and `just vm-smoke`. It ran the
  fast gate *and* a VM loop under a name that described neither, so the gate
  looked like optional developer feedback and the VM loop looked like a
  release-adjacent proof. `fast-test` is now the fast gate itself -- the same
  `_test-fast` module `test` and both release lanes run, so it cannot drift
  from them -- and `vm-smoke` is a short VM round-trip that answers runtime
  liveness only. This is a deliberate public-surface change.

### Fixed

- `bootstrap.sh --yes` now provisions Linux instead of printing Docker setup
  hints and failing later. It installs the native compiler/Tauri dependencies,
  the distro's actual Buildx package, Bubblewrap, `cpio`, and a SHA256-verified Node
  runtime whose major comes from the profile image configuration; pins pnpm
  10; starts Docker; adds durable Docker/KVM group membership; and grants the
  current process narrow socket/device ACLs so the same bootstrap can finish
  without a logout. Doctor now enforces the configured Node floor and points
  Linux users back to that canonical setup path.

- Linux filesystem observation no longer treats watchdog's
  `closed_no_write` event as a source mutation. Ordinary compiler and profile
  reads previously produced thousands of false faults, repeatedly hashed
  source inputs, grew the gate by gigabytes, and prevented a clean bootstrap
  from completing; close-after-write and all real mutation events remain
  observed.

- Former `docs.capsem.org` routes now publish source-derived noindex holding
  tombstones with no-store Pages headers. The first holding deployment removed
  those files, but a warmed Cloudflare edge continued serving the previous
  Starlight guide under its week-long shared-cache policy; the deploy smoke now
  proves the replacement body and rejects the old guide/install content.

- The observer records a symlink where it was created, not where it points.
  `symlink` was missing from the set of calls whose destination is the second
  argument, so `Path.symlink_to("arm64")` recorded the bare target, which
  `resolve()` then anchored to the checkout root -- reporting a write to
  `<root>/arm64`, a path no step touched and nothing gitignores, and therefore
  judged to be source. Harmless while faults were only logged; the moment a
  source-tree fault began aborting releases it stopped one at
  `assets.assemble`.

- Report mode writes its allow-list. The streamer starts in `reexec()`, before
  the run directory exists, so `latest` still pointed at the *previous* run;
  the resource resolved the same expression afterwards and got the current one.
  Both sides used a real path and they were different ones, so every capture
  landed in an older run's directory and the summary step found nothing --
  35 MB of collected events and no allow-list, with nothing failing. The path
  is fixed on both sides now and moved into the run it describes at release.

- The enforcing sandbox profile carries the sockets the gate actually opens.
  One report-mode run named them, and three classes were missing: the per-user
  `$TMPDIR` under `/private/var/folders` (which is why a rule naming
  `/tmp/capsem-` looked complete and was not), the workspace run directory
  inside the prefix, and Colima's Lima socket. Local bind and inbound are
  permitted too -- the gate starts servers and talks to them, and that is not
  the mid-run fetch being denied. Verified directly: the internet is denied,
  Docker and loopback still work.
- The report parser reads ndjson instead of regex-matching the raw line, so a
  record's `traceID` and `processImageUUID` no longer ride along inside the
  resource and make one socket look like a thousand distinct rules.

- `capsem-install-release-site-dist` is governed by the storage policy. It was
  mounted on every install run with no entry at all, so no retention, owner or
  budget applied to it -- invisible to the disk budget and to `gc`, growing
  until a run would die on `no space left on device` with the cause being a
  resource nothing ever claimed. A contract now refuses both an ungoverned
  mount and a volume marked obsolete while something still mounts it.

- The install image bakes the release-site dependencies, and the cross-run
  `capsem-install-release-site-node-modules` volume is retired. That volume
  existed so `pnpm install` would not write into a bind-mounted checkout; the
  source is an image layer now, so its reason is gone and what remained was
  worse -- an older run's `node_modules` mounted over a different
  `build_system/release_site/`, which pnpm rightly refused to reconcile unprompted. Baked,
  the runtime `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` finds a tree that already
  matches and does nothing.
- The install proof's `pnpm install` no longer stops waiting for an answer.
  `/src/build_system/release_site` comes from the image while its `node_modules` is a
  cross-run volume, so the two can legitimately disagree, and pnpm refuses to
  purge a modules directory it did not create without a TTY to confirm on --
  `ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY`. The gate has no terminal and
  no operator, so it says so with `CI=true`.

- The install proof and the deb proof can see the package they verify again.
  Sealing those lanes removed the mount they read `dist/*.deb` through, and the
  package is written after the image is built so no `COPY` can carry it --
  `dpkg-deb: failed to read archive '/src/dist/Capsem_0.6.0_arm64.deb'`. Both
  now declare `dist`, `assets` and `target/config` as read-only generated
  inputs; a proof that could write into what it proves would prove nothing.

- A resumed gate no longer measures its tree against a stale index. Refreshing
  a prefix copied `.git` *into* the existing `.git` -- `cp -R a b` nests when
  `b` exists -- so the prefix's real repository was never updated. Deleting a
  tracked file then made `git ls-files` still name it, the source digest tried
  to stat a path that was gone, and the run died with a raw traceback before
  its first step. Carried paths are replaced now, not merged.

- The Linux package build no longer needs a Git repository inside its
  container. Sealing the lane into an image removed `.git` -- `.dockerignore`
  excludes it -- so `check-build-provenance.sh` died with `fatal: not a git
  repository` and took the package step with it. The gate now passes the
  revision it already recorded, `build.rs` prefers it over asking git, and the
  provenance guard still refuses a binary that does not embed it. Provenance
  is a declared input now rather than an ambient read of whatever repository
  happened to be reachable.
- The public-surface count-drift guard mutated `count = 13` to `14` to prove
  drift fails closed. When the surface legitimately reached 14 the mutation
  became a no-op that rewrote the file to what it already said -- a guard
  passing because it had stopped changing anything. It now derives the count.
- A flaky observation test no longer fails the gate at random. It waited on
  `watch.events` while asserting about `watch.faults`, and `Watch.observed`
  appends the event before judging it -- both on the watchdog thread -- so the
  assertion could win the race into the gap between the two. Measured at three
  failures in five runs on an unchanged tree; zero in twenty after.
- Report mode's collector runs outside the sandbox it measures. `/usr/bin/log`
  refuses to run sandboxed -- `log: Cannot run while sandboxed` -- so a
  collector started from a resource captured 32 bytes of that refusal and
  nothing else. It now starts immediately before the sandboxed re-exec and is
  stopped through a pidfile from the other side of it.
- Report mode now records what the sandbox permitted. The profile was being
  generated and applied, but nothing read the unified log that `(with report)`
  writes to, so a complete report-mode gate run produced zero sandbox entries
  and the allow-list an enforcing profile needs could never be built. A
  `log stream` collector runs for the life of the run and writes both the raw
  capture and a deduplicated allow-list into the run directory.
- The Linux package lane no longer mounts the checkout. Its source is copied
  into a lane image, so a host step and the container can no longer race the
  same inodes. The mount it replaces could not be made read-only: the frontend
  bundler writes atomic temporaries directly in `web/app/`, and grafting
  container scratch over `web/app/` would have masked the source being built.
- A service restarting after a crash now actually reaps the per-VM
  `capsem-process` children its predecessor orphaned. The reaper shelled out to
  `/bin/ps`, which is setuid root and which macOS refuses to exec from a
  sandboxed process, and it treated the failed spawn as "no orphans found" --
  so under the release gate the reap silently never happened and six processes
  outlived a complete run by half an hour, each still holding its run
  directory. The process table is now read with `proc_listallpids` and
  `KERN_PROCARGS2`, an enumeration failure is logged rather than swallowed, and
  a source contract keeps the next copy of this from being written.
- Both release commands now run the complete gate from a private copy of the
  checkout, and publish from the checkout itself. Only `candidate` had the
  copy, so the two commands whose mistakes are public and irreversible were the
  ones still qualifying a tree anybody could edit mid-run -- the exact failure
  that killed a release at `source.verify` after 61 minutes.

  Composed inside the existing release contract rather than around it. The
  first design split the release into three sibling processes bound by a
  receipt, which `AGENTS.md` rules out twice over: one process, one machine
  lock, one workspace and one plan, and no parallel release ledger or result
  file. It stays one plan; inside it the gate reads the copy and every step
  that prechecks, stamps, commits, tags, pushes or dispatches is aimed at the
  originating checkout. A push issued from the copy would reach a `.git`
  reclaimed minutes later -- a release reporting success and publishing
  nothing anyone could see.

  `record-head` now records that checkout's revision rather than the copy's
  frozen one, so `confirm-head` re-asserts something that can actually have
  moved.

- Six release contracts that asserted on the *source text* of gate modules now
  assert on behaviour or on the current interface. Every one broke on a
  refactor that changed no behaviour at all — `'--no-cache' in installimage.py`,
  `'platform,' in crossexec.py`, `.index()` of argv fragments the Docker
  wrapper migration rewrote. They are reimplemented, not deleted.

- The tray-singleton test asks `pidfiles.running` instead of shelling `ps`. It
  kept its own copy of a question production already answers, so the fix below
  never reached it — and `/bin/ps` is setuid root, which macOS forbids a
  sandboxed process from exec'ing whatever the profile permits. It therefore
  failed in two consecutive gate runs while passing every way it could be run
  by hand, which is the signature of an environment-specific defect rather
  than a flaky test.

- Process liveness no longer shells out to `ps`, which a sandboxed gate cannot
  execute at all. `/bin/ps` is setuid root and the macOS sandbox forbids
  exec'ing a setuid binary — `(allow default)` does not override that — so the
  gate's own liveness check failed under the gate's own sandbox with
  `PermissionError: Operation not permitted: 'ps'`. `proc_pidinfo` answers the
  same question with a syscall: it reports a state for a live process and
  fails for a zombie, which has no BSD info left to report. Faster too, and no
  fork per check.

- Report mode permits and logs rather than denying and logging. `(with
  report)` is a modifier on *allow*; attaching it to a denial is refused
  outright — `sandbox-exec: report modifier does not apply to deny action` —
  and the run dies before it starts. That is also why one report run is
  enough: nothing is refused, so nothing stops early and what comes back is
  the whole surface rather than the first thing reached.

- `--sandbox off|report|enforce` runs a command under that profile, applied at
  the same seam as the private copy and the keep-awake wrapper — before any
  resource is held. A Seatbelt profile is inherited by every child and cannot
  be dropped, so applying it in-process would sandbox the parent that still
  has to reclaim the prefix, and applying it after the machine lock would
  leave the sandboxed child waiting out its own parent's 7200-second timeout.
  Off by default: the profile denies the network, and most commands are short
  reads that would only rediscover which socket they needed.

  The profile is written into the run's own directory, so a refused run's
  evidence includes the exact rules it was refused by rather than ones
  reconstructed afterwards.

- `capsem.gate.sandbox` generates the macOS Seatbelt profile a run executes
  under, from `[sandbox]` in `config/gate.toml`. `(allow default)` narrowed by
  targeted denials rather than `(deny default)` widened by enumerated allows —
  the second was measured and abandoned, because every read list produced a
  silent `SIGABRT` and the kernel's denial log needs sudo to read.

  Proven against the kernel rather than asserted: under the generated profile
  `docker version` answers `29.2.1` over its UNIX socket, `curl https://1.1.1.1`
  is refused in 0 ms, and loopback to the gateway is open. Two facts it
  encodes that cost a day each to learn the hard way — `(deny network*)`
  denies AF_UNIX too, so an unallowed Docker socket looks exactly like a
  stopped daemon; and SBPL accepts only `*` or `localhost` as a host, so
  `127.0.0.1:*` is not a narrower rule but a profile that will not load.

- The asset build no longer touches `crates/capsem-app/build.rs` to force a
  rebuild. The comment said it was "so cargo re-runs build.rs and picks up the
  new manifest hashes", and that crate's `build.rs` reads nothing — it
  forwards one environment variable and calls `tauri_build::build()`, and its
  `tauri.conf.json` bundles only `web/app/dist`. There were no manifest
  hashes to pick up, so every asset build rebuilt the Tauri app for nothing
  and wrote into the gate's own tracked source to do it. A crate that really
  depends on a file says so with `cargo:rerun-if-changed`, which is what
  `crates/capsem/build.rs` does for the git metadata it embeds.

- **Phase 3 is complete: `docker.py` is the only place that spells `docker`.**
  The builder image's build and its foreign-UID probe were the last two
  hand-built argv, and the probe wanted a third thing the wrapper could not
  do — not "run this" or "did it work" but "what did it say". `Docker.read`
  answers that. Every container in the gate now declares its network mode
  because the wrapper requires it, rather than getting outbound access because
  nobody passed a flag.

  Six checkout mounts remain, all declared and counted. None is new: every one
  was an inline `-v` that no guard could see, and the list can only shrink now.

- The observer stops reporting gitignored build output as source, including
  trees the run creates. It compared
  only the *first* path component against a hand-written set of build-output
  names, so nothing nested could ever match: `crates/capsem-app/gen/` is
  gitignored Tauri output and was reported as a source-tree fault on every
  run. Git is asked instead, about the *rules* rather than about today's
  files: `git check-ignore` answers for a path whether or not it exists, which
  matters because that directory is gitignored and so is absent from the
  private copy until Tauri's build script creates it mid-run. Memoized per
  directory, since the classifier is on the path of every filesystem operation
  the gate makes.

  The names stay alongside it rather than being replaced: a test fixture is
  not always a git repository, and git answers nothing outside one, which
  would make every path "source".

- `fast.audit.generated-settings` writes its tracked outputs to scratch. The
  step exists to produce the *gitignored* frontend mock the web surfaces
  import; rewriting `config/settings/*.generated.json` in the checkout it is
  qualifying was a side effect. `source.verify` tolerated it only because the
  bytes matched, and a sandboxed run could not do it at all. Drift is still
  caught, by `contracts.release`, which is the step whose job that is.

  This was the writer the observer kept reporting after the checker was fixed:
  two paths ran the generator, and only one of them had been changed.

- Resuming into a kept prefix no longer deletes what the earlier run built.
  `refresh` removes what the source no longer names, and the first version
  walked the whole tree sparing a hand-written list of exports and carried
  paths — so everything *else* gitignored was fair game, including `.venv`.
  The first real resume died before its first step with "Project virtual
  environment … no Python executable was found", which is the entire cost the
  prefix exists to avoid. It now asks the command that defines the subject, so
  an ignored path is never a candidate: one definition of what the tree is,
  shared by the digest, the copy and the deletion pass.

- The install-test image's smoke check declares `bridge`, not `none`. It shells
  `uv run`, which syncs the project environment inside the container rather
  than merely invoking a tool the image already has — 51 packages, measured.
  Denying it produced a dependency-resolution hint that reads like a broken
  Dockerfile rather than a missing network, which is the diagnosis it got.

- The install-test image build and its smoke check go through the Docker
  wrapper too, so both declare their network. One module is left building
  `docker` argv by hand, down from four at the start of this work.

  `docker.py` crossed the module ceiling again; image operations — build,
  identity, existence — are `dockerimage.py`, mixed in so no call site has to
  know which half of `Docker` it is reaching for. They change on a different
  rhythm from containers: a base image outlives hundreds of runs, a container
  outlives one step.

- The cross-architecture execution preflight goes through the Docker wrapper,
  so it declares `--network none` like every other container. It had built its
  own `docker run` because the wrapper had no way to *ask* a question --
  `run_once` raises, which is right for work and wrong for a preflight whose
  answer is the exit status. `Docker.probe` returns that answer. Two of the
  four remaining hand-built argv sites are gone this session.

- The generated-settings check no longer rewrites the checkout's own tracked
  files. It overwrote `config/settings/schema.generated.json` and
  `ui-metadata.generated.json` and diffed them against a snapshot; the
  generator takes `--settings-dir` now, so the check generates into scratch
  and compares. Byte-identical output made the write invisible, and it is what
  would stop the gate running against a source tree it may not write to. The
  gitignored frontend mock is still written into the checkout, because the web
  checks import it.

- `initrd.repack` no longer chmods tracked source files, which would have
  failed every clean-checkout run. It set `0555` on
  `guest/artifacts/{capsem-doctor,capsem-bench,snapshots}` — recorded `100755`
  by git, which does not track the write bit, so the change was invisible to
  `git status` and fatal to `source.verify`: the source digest hashes the
  mode, so a fresh clone records `755`, the repack drops it to `555`, and the
  run ends an hour later claiming the gate changed its own source. It passed
  on this machine only because the files had already been `555` since some
  earlier run — a cross-run leftover a warm machine depended on and a clean
  checkout cannot supply. The copy's mode was always set separately, so the
  source chmod never affected the initrd at all.

- The Linux package lane's checkout mount stays writable, and now says why.
  Making it `:ro` looked right — the build's outputs all go to container-local
  scratch — and failed a real run: the frontend bundler writes atomic
  temporaries beside its target, directly in `web/app/`, so the container
  reported `EROFS ... open '/src/web/app/_tmp_50_…'`. Grafting scratch over
  `web/app/` would mask the source being compiled, so no flag fixes it;
  baking the frontend into the builder image does, which is Phase 5's second
  half. The outputs stay container-local either way.

- The Linux package lane no longer mounts the checkout writable. It writes
  into its source for three real reasons -- `pnpm install` fills
  `web/app/node_modules`, `pnpm build` fills `web/app/dist`, and Tauri
  regenerates ACL schemas into the app crate -- and all three are now
  container-local anonymous volumes grafted over those paths, so the mount is
  `:ro` and none of those writes reaches the host. That is the last read-write
  mount of the run root, and the class of race that killed a release run with
  an intermittent EACCES on a file that was `0644` before and after.

  `docker rm` takes `-v` with it, because an anonymous volume has no name and
  nothing else could ever collect the 356 MB one.

- The Linux package lane extracts its artifacts instead of writing them back
  through the bind mount. It creates a container, starts it, copies the deb,
  the record and the agent binaries out with `docker cp`, and removes it —
  copying on the failure path too, because a build that failed after producing
  a package is exactly when the package is worth looking at. "The builder
  produced it" and "the host can read it" are two events now instead of one
  write into a tree a host step may be reading.

  The lane's `docker` argv is gone with it, so the boundary ratchet drops to
  three modules. `Docker.create` grew mounts, a working directory, and a
  distinction it did not have: `env` writes `-e NAME=value` into argv, while
  `forward` writes `-e NAME` and leaves the value to `carry`, which becomes
  the environment of the `docker` process itself. A declared secret passed as
  `env` is now refused rather than redacted — redaction keeps the run log
  clean and leaves the value in `ps`, which is the leak that mattered.

  `docker.py` crossed the 300-line ceiling doing this; the addressing half —
  what may be mounted, and where a checkout path lands inside a container — is
  `dockermount.py`.

- A linked worktree's Git metadata mount is now declared rather than assembled
  as bare `-v` argv, so the checkout-mount guard can see it. It is a mount of
  the primary checkout — the common directory lives there — and it had been
  invisible to the boundary the whole time. Nothing new is mounted; the count
  went up because the truth did.

  Groundwork for the package lane: it writes `dist/*.deb` back through a
  read-write mount of the run root, and the builder script now takes
  `CAPSEM_PACKAGE_OUTPUT_DIR` so that output can be extracted with `docker cp`
  instead. The script still defaults to the mount, so behaviour is unchanged
  until the lane is switched over.

- The Linux parity lane now builds its own base image instead of naming a
  recipe for the operator to run. The lane still refuses to build it *inside*
  the sealed run -- a multi-gigabyte fetch there is what sealing prevents --
  but that refusal was the whole answer, and it arrived twenty-five minutes
  into the gate on the machine that had already spent them. Warming is a step
  before the lane now, with network, and costs a tag check when the image is
  already there. `just test` is self-sufficient on a clean machine, which is
  what `AGENTS.md` asks of every module.

- Python static-analysis debt is now an exact per-rule count that can only
  shrink, not a list of rules held back wholesale. `ty_ratchet` names how many
  of each diagnostic the relaxed trees may carry, and a suppression budget
  pins the exact number of `noqa`, `type: ignore`, `ty: ignore` and Ruff
  ignores — so a new one is a deliberate decision rather than an invisible
  addition to a family already forgiven.

  Introducing it surfaced eleven diagnostics and three suppressions added
  since the ratchet was written, all of which are fixed rather than recorded:
  the shared `RecordingJournal` had silently stopped satisfying the `Journal`
  protocol when `carried` was added for resume, so nine call sites were passing
  a double that no longer matched; two `SimpleNamespace` stand-ins that needed
  type suppressions to be passed at all are real `Context` objects; a `rmtree`
  stub is `monkeypatch.setattr`; one `ty: ignore` was doing nothing; and two
  registration imports go through the test helper that already owns them.

- Every `serial`-marked test now has an execution rail, and a guard says so.
  The broad suite deselects `serial`, so such a test runs only if some rail
  claims it by path — and `tests/ironbank/test_route_latency.py` was claimed by
  none, so the gate had never once run it while reporting success. The route
  latency probes are on the serial rail now, beside route health.

- The fast phase strictly collects every Python test. `--collect-only` with
  `--strict-config --strict-markers` and no cache writes, so a suite that
  cannot be imported, a typo'd marker or an unknown config key fails in
  seconds. The Python counterpart of what `rustinventory` already does for
  nextest — a suite the gate is silently not running is otherwise discovered
  an hour later, or not at all.

- The expensive phases now wait for the whole fast phase, not for Clippy. The
  fast phase reported completion with whichever step happened to be added last,
  and Clippy waits on the Rust toolchain and one web surface and nothing else
  -- so Ruff, both Ty passes, every dependency audit and three of the four web
  surfaces gated nothing, and were free to still be running while the gate
  built assets and booted VMs. "The cheap failures run before the expensive
  work" was true of one of them.

- Each `exec` event now carries the byte range its command wrote in the step
  log. A step's log is one file and a step runs many commands, so ten
  commands' output interleaved with no boundaries was a file you could read
  and not navigate -- the question is always "what did *that* one print", and
  the answer was "somewhere in here". A pointer, not a copy: duplicating the
  bytes would double the largest thing a run produces and put the same output
  in two places that can disagree.

- Detached processes are back inside the run-log schema. `Launch` was defined
  and emitted, and missing from the payload registry -- so every daemon the
  gate started wrote a line no reader had a model for, which is the one thing
  the registry exists to make impossible. The list is derived from the models
  now instead of maintained beside them, and the test that validates every
  emitted line has to emit one of each: it wrote five of eleven and passed,
  never having launched anything.

- The Linux parity base image is now keyed by everything that defines it, not
  by three lockfiles. `warm-linux-rust-base` skips the build whenever the tag
  exists, so an input missing from the key is an environment change the sealed
  lane silently never sees -- and two were missing: the Dockerfile, which
  carries the ONNX Runtime version and every build argument's default, and the
  mutable `capsem-host-builder:latest` the image is `FROM`. A rebuilt parent
  left the lane testing against the toolchain, packages and CA bundle of an
  image that no longer existed under that name. The tag now includes the
  Dockerfile's bytes and the parent's image id, so the first `just test` after
  this rebuilds the base image once.

- A private copy is now checked against the checkout it was made from instead
  of assumed faithful. Copying 2500 files takes 2.2 seconds, and an edit
  landing inside that window produced a tree holding some files from before it
  and some from after -- a combination that existed at no instant in the
  checkout, and which then became the frozen subject of the whole run and
  passed `source.verify` an hour later. Both trees are hashed with the same
  script `source.record` uses, and a mismatch is refused with the checkout
  named. Resume gets the same check, where it also proves the pass that removes
  files the source no longer has actually ran.

- `source.verify` now compares the originating checkout's *digest*, not only
  its `HEAD`. The gate deliberately supports uncommitted work, so an ordinary
  save during a forty-minute run changes the tree being released without moving
  `HEAD` at all -- and against a private copy every other comparison is frozen
  by construction, so nothing saw it. `build_system/scripts/build/source-state-digest.py` takes
  `--root` for this: a run inside a copy has to be able to hash the tree it was
  copied from.

- A failed run's prefix is now reclaimed by the next one. Keeping it for
  `--prefix` was deliberate, but nothing ever removed it: `[disk] reclaimable`
  only accepts paths inside the checkout, so `gc` never reached `~/.cg`. One
  retained tree on this machine was 22 GiB and carried the copied signing
  material with it. Swept on entry rather than on exit, the same shape as the
  workspace home, so a crash still leaves something to inspect and the run
  after it is the one that cleans up. `reclaim` also stopped reporting success
  on a tree it failed to remove.

- A linked worktree is refused instead of half-isolated. Its `.git` is a file
  holding an absolute pointer into another repository, so copying it left the
  prefix following the original's `HEAD` -- a commit over there moved the
  supposedly private tree, and the isolation quietly became the detection it
  was built to replace. This repository really uses linked worktrees, so the
  case was reachable.

- Resuming refreshes the copy instead of layering onto it. It only ever copied
  the current source *over* the old, so a file deleted from the checkout
  survived into the resumed tree -- the run then compiled and tested something
  the operator no longer had, while its run log described the tree they thought
  they retried. The carried paths are refreshed too, since `.git` moves
  whenever someone commits between attempts. The test that claimed to cover
  this called `populate()` twice while production called a different branch; it
  exercises the production path now.

- The host binary list is derived from `cargo metadata` instead of from
  yesterday's failure. Three runs from a clean checkout each died on one
  missing binary -- `capsem` at `codesign`, `capsem-mcp-aggregator` at the VM
  boot, `capsem-tray` in the build-chain suite -- and each fix added the single
  name that failure happened to reach, at twenty-odd minutes per discovery.
  `[signing] built` is now the whole host cohort, and
  `test_the_built_binaries_are_every_host_binary` fails when a workspace binary
  is missing from it or when a name in it no longer exists. The two exclusions
  are declared rather than implied: `capsem-app` embeds `web/app/dist` and
  belongs to `build-ui`, and the guest crate's musl binaries belong to
  `initrd.guest-agents`.

- Reusing a prefix died on `FileExistsError` before any step ran. Refreshing
  the source into an existing tree is an overwrite, which `cp` does for regular
  files and `os.symlink` refuses -- so the first real `--prefix` run stopped in
  under a second on `.agents/skills`.

- Four more inputs the gate inherited from history rather than producing, all
  surfaced by the first complete run from a private checkout and all invisible
  on a warm machine:

  `test-release-contracts` ran `pnpm --dir build_system/release_site run build:channel`
  without installing `node_modules`, which is gitignored -- so on a clean tree
  the suite died with `sh: astro: command not found`. It now installs the Node
  workspaces itself, which AGENTS.md requires of every module and this one did
  not do.

  The install contracts planned around `dist/Capsem_<version>_<arch>.deb`.
  Their helper runs the plan against a recording runner to capture real argv,
  and `install` refuses without that package, so `contextlib.suppress` swallowed
  the refusal and five contracts asserted against a two-step transcript. They
  now create the package when it is genuinely absent and remove it again,
  rather than depending on an earlier `just _cross-compile`.

  `test_acquiring_the_service_starts_it_and_waits_for_its_socket` copied
  `target/config/profiles` into its workspace -- build output from
  `prepare.materialize-config`. It makes that input now.

  Two assertions in the release doctor contract only ever saw
  `generate-host-binary-sbom.py` because a warm tree let the recorded plan run
  reach it; the SBOM steps are `Call`s that describe themselves in prose. They
  now assert the named step and the config it is built from, which is the same
  claim without the dependency on machine state.

- `test-fast` and `test-static` depended on a generated file that nothing in
  their lane generated. The web surfaces import
  `web/app/src/lib/mock-settings.generated.ts`, which is gitignored, and both
  modules only ran `_check-generated-settings` -- which asserts the committed
  schema and the generated output agree, not that the output exists. On a warm
  machine it arrived from an earlier build; on a clean one `svelte-check`
  stopped at `Cannot find module './mock-settings.generated'`.

  Found on the first real run from a private checkout, which is the point of
  having one: this is the same class as the CI failure where 94 tests reported
  `no materialized profiles found`, and the same class the plan calls
  cross-run leftovers being load-bearing. The fast phase now generates the
  settings before the surfaces that import them, after the Rust toolchain
  because the generator needs `cargo run -p capsem-core --bin mcp_export` --
  work this lane already pays for when clippy builds the same workspace.

### Fixed

- The hand-built-`docker`-argv ratchet had stopped being one. `UNMIGRATED` in
  `build_system/tests/gate/test_gate_docker_boundary.py` still carried the original nine sites
  while the real count was six, so `hostimage.py` was allowed 5 against an
  actual 2 -- three new hand-built `docker` argv could have been added to it
  with every guard staying green, in the module the packaging work is about to
  rewrite. The counts are now exact, and `test_the_ratchet_carries_no_slack`
  fails when an allowance exceeds its debt, so paying the debt down without
  lowering the number is no longer invisible.

### Removed

- Removed the obsolete top-level zstd archive-compression settings. VM rootfs
  assets have one fail-closed format authority: EROFS with its independently
  validated lz4/lz4hc settings. The unrelated zstd runtime tool used to inspect
  Debian packages remains available.

- The four `capsem-linux-rust-*` volumes are retired, along with the step that
  existed to hand one of them back. Sealing the Linux parity lane stopped it
  mounting anything -- it `COPY`s its source into a thin image on a
  lockfile-keyed base and runs with no mounts and no network -- but the policy
  still declared `capsem-linux-rust-target` as `working` with a
  `release_boundary`, and the three caches as `cache`. So an 11 GiB volume with
  no producer kept a whole `after-linux-rust` boundary and a
  `completed-linux-rust-target` step alive to release space nothing was
  holding.

  The pins that described the old arrangement were reimplemented rather than
  deleted, and both are stronger for it. `test_docker_storage_policy.py`
  asserted one volume's consumer and boundary; it now asserts all four name
  neither, which keeps a producerless volume out of the graph entirely.
  `test_install_asset_payload.py` asserted the release happened between the
  lane and `assets.preflight`; the assets can no longer be starved by a tree
  the lane never holds, so it asserts the releasing step and its boundary do
  not exist. `test_every_release_boundary_reclaims_something` is what caught
  the leftover phase, exactly as its docstring said it would.

### Added

- `capsem-linux-rust-base` is declared `generational` in
  `config/storage-policy.toml`, and warming it now retires the tags it
  supersedes. The image is tagged by a blake2b of `Cargo.lock`,
  `rust-toolchain.toml` and `web/app/pnpm-lock.yaml`, so every bump of any of
  the three mints a new ~25 GiB tag -- and nothing retired the old ones. A
  single `fast-uri` security bump left three coexisting on a VM with 54.7 GiB
  free; left alone that reaches disk-full in the middle of a two-hour release
  rather than at a point where it is cheap.

  Not by relaxing the rule that automatic GC never prunes tagged images -- that
  rule is what stops a running gate losing the image it is about to use.
  Instead `docker-storage-policy.py reclaim` retires the *superseded* tags of
  one repository, anchored on a tag the caller names: once
  `warm-linux-rust-base` holds the tag the current lockfiles resolve to, no run
  can want another, because the lane derives its tag the same way and refuses
  to start when it is missing. It runs on the already-present path too, so a
  machine that is already warm with stale tags beside it is cleared before the
  next bump adds a fourth, rather than after.

  `keep_previous = 0`: one previous generation is not the cheap revert it looks
  like. Removing a tag leaves the BuildKit layer cache untouched, and that
  cache is what makes a rebuild fast -- re-tagging a generation whose layers
  are still cached is sub-second and needs no network. A kept tag only pays
  once those layers have aged out too, and then it is a full network rebuild
  either way.

- `just _warm-linux-rust-base` builds the Linux parity base image, with
  network, before a sealed run needs it. The lane deliberately refuses to build
  it mid-run -- its tag is keyed by `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml` and
  `web/app/pnpm-lock.yaml`, so a dependency bump re-keys it, and resolving
  that inside the run would turn a `--network none` lane into a multi-gigabyte
  network build at minute four -- and its refusal named `just warm`, which did
  not exist. Bumping `fast-uri` for a security advisory re-keyed the image and
  found it: the release stopped correctly and handed back a command that fails.

  A contract now checks that every recipe the gate names in an operator-facing
  message is a recipe the justfile defines. `hostimage.py` already carried a
  note about the last time this happened -- `just _build-host-image`, dispatched
  by two lanes, never written -- so it is a class, not an incident.

### Fixed

- `capsem-gate doctor` no longer reads a justfile comment as a dispatch. It
  scanned every line containing `capsem-gate `, so prose naming a subcommand
  was parsed as a call to ``linux-rust` `` -- trailing backtick included -- and
  reported as unknown. Three doctor checks went red on a comment.

- `test_a_live_run_is_never_rotated_away_by_another` no longer answers
  differently depending on how pytest was started. A spawned child re-imports
  its target's module with nothing but a copy of the parent's `sys.path`, and
  `--import-mode=importlib` names test modules `tests.<basename>` without ever
  putting the repository root on that path -- so the name resolved under
  `python -m pytest`, which contributes the working directory and is how the
  gate invokes every suite, and not under the `pytest` console script. Run the
  file on its own and the child died on `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'tests'` while the parent sat out a sixty-second queue timeout. The worker
  moved to `tests/helpers/`, which the root conftest puts on `sys.path` before
  collection under every invocation and in every xdist worker. Spawn is
  unchanged: cross-process rotation safety is the point, and it is the
  stricter start method.

- The gate's ordering contracts run from a linked git worktree again.
  `docker_git_metadata_mount` skips its probe entirely when `.git` is a
  directory, so an ordinary checkout never asks; a worktree carries a `.git`
  file instead, asks `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, and got "" back from a
  recording runner that answers nothing by default. An unresolvable common dir
  is a build the gate rightly refuses, so the recorded plan died at
  `package.<arch>.build` and every contract about a command issued at or after
  that point failed for want of a git answer rather than for anything it was
  about -- on worktrees only, which is why it stayed invisible. The recorder
  now answers that one probe from the real repository, truthfully, because a
  wrong path here becomes a `-v` mount those same contracts assert against.

### Security

- `fast-uri` is bounded past GHSA-7p8r-x3mc-p8w7 (host confusion via a
  backslash authority introducer). The frontend's override read `>=3.1.2`,
  which resolved to 4.1.1 -- inside the advisory's `>=4.0.0 <4.1.2` -- so the
  bound admitted the very version it was there to exclude. Now `>=4.1.2`. It
  arrives through `@astrojs/check`, so it is dev-only tooling, but the audit is
  a release gate and blocked one.

### Fixed

- The filesystem observer reported 42 phantom source mutations on every release
  run, and each named a file nothing had touched. `shutil.rmtree` deletes
  through a directory descriptor -- `os.unlink('profile.toml', dir_fd=5)` -- so
  a bare entry name reached the observer, which resolved it against the current
  working directory. That directory is the checkout root, so removing
  `target/config/profiles/code/profile.toml`, an ordinary step, was reported as

      [source-tree] profile.toml: unlink during the run

  naming the tracked `config/profiles` file of the same basename. A guard that
  cries wolf 42 times a run is a guard nobody reads, and this is the guard that
  exists to catch the `config/profiles` race that killed a release run.

  Fixed in three places, because one of them alone would have hidden the
  others. Interception now resolves a subject against its `dir_fd` (and
  resolves an integer descriptor subject, as in `os.truncate(fd, n)`), so the
  fault names where the call acted. The judge refuses to classify any path that
  is not absolute, so no caller's loose spelling can be misattributed again --
  not merely the one that was found. And `dist`, `packages` and `assets` join
  `target` as build output: all are gitignored roots the gate rewrites every
  run, and with only `target` excluded, resyncing `assets/current` or clearing
  a stale `.deb` read as mutating the tree being qualified.

  When a path genuinely cannot be established the event is not judged at all: a
  fault nobody can locate is not evidence, and inventing one is worse than
  missing it.

### Security

- The local Tauri signing key and its password no longer reach anything that
  writes them down. The package rail read both out of `private/tauri/` and put
  them into `docker run`'s argv as `-e NAME=value`, so the values appeared in
  the process listing -- world-readable through `ps`, and beyond the reach of
  any log filtering -- and then in `target/gate-runs/*/run.jsonl`, in the step
  error of a failed build, in `run.end`'s failures, and in the summary. That
  directly contradicted the run log's own claim that a run directory is safe to
  attach to a bug report. Docker now receives `-e NAME` and takes the value
  from its own environment, and secrecy is declared on the invocation itself:
  a `Command` that names a credential cannot render it, in argv or in the
  environment, through `str()`, the journal, or the exception a failure raises.
  The variable name is kept and the value becomes `<redacted>`.

### Changed

- Sealing the Linux parity lane left its old machinery behind, and the release
  gate caught it. `_LinuxRustSuite` -- the action that assembled the read-only
  source mount, the writable grafts and the four named volumes -- was still in
  `hostimage.py` with nothing constructing it, along with nine `[hostimage]`
  settings that existed only to repair what sharing a checkout with a
  root-owned container broke: a writable `/tmp`, a hand-placed `HOME`, a
  bound-out nextest directory, a writable graft for Tauri's generated ACLs, and
  the volumes themselves. All are gone.

  Restored in the same pass: the lane raised a named error on a host that is
  neither Linux nor macOS, and sealing it dropped that guard, so a third
  platform fell through to the Docker path and would have failed somewhere
  inside a container instead of saying which host it will not run on.

  The two contract tests that pinned the old mechanism are reimplemented rather
  than deleted, and two of their claims are now stronger: `/src:ro` said the
  container could not write the checkout, where the assertion is now that
  nothing is mounted at all; and the lane's `--network none` is asserted, which
  no earlier test could claim because it was not true.

- The Linux parity lane holds its own bytes. It bind-mounted the live checkout,
  grafted two writable mounts back through it to retrieve coverage, inherited
  four named volumes that survive between runs, and ran with outbound network
  because nothing ever passed `--network`. It now builds its source into an
  image, runs with `--network none`, and returns coverage through `docker cp`.
  Dependencies live in a base image keyed by `Cargo.lock`,
  `rust-toolchain.toml` and `web/app/pnpm-lock.yaml`; a lockfile change makes
  a new tag and the gate refuses to start rather than rebuilding multiple
  gigabytes at minute four.

  Sealing it surfaced two fetches nobody had recorded. The lane built the
  frontend with `pnpm install` mid-run whenever `web/app/dist` was absent, and
  `ort` -- ONNX Runtime, under `magika` -- downloaded a binary from
  `cdn.pyke.io` inside a build script on every cold build. Both now come from
  the image: the frontend is built there, and ONNX Runtime is Microsoft's
  official release with `ORT_STRATEGY=system` and `ORT_PREFER_DYNAMIC_LINK`.

- Containers now declare their network, and a mount of the working tree is
  refused. Nothing in the gate passed `--network` at all, so every container
  had outbound access by omission and several fetched dependencies mid-run --
  the difference between proving a build reproduces and proving it reproduces
  today. `Mount` refuses a source inside the checkout, because
  `-v <repo_root>:/src` let a host step churning hardlinks and a container
  reading the same inodes over virtiofs share a filesystem neither declared,
  which killed a release run with an intermittent `Permission denied` on a
  file that was `0644` before and after. The two privileged install
  containers still need both and say so through `Mount.unmigrated`, which a
  test enumerates so the count can only shrink.

- Every `Call` answers, in a form a machine can read, why it is not an ordinary
  declared action and what it can affect. It carried a required kind before;
  now it carries a closed kind, a reason its author wrote, and a declared
  effect set, all of which reach the dry run and `run.jsonl`. A pure inspection
  that declares a filesystem effect is refused, because that label is the
  weakest of the four and therefore the most tempting. A contract rejects
  placeholder reasons -- "temporary", "misc", "legacy", "TODO" -- since that is
  how an exemption stops describing outstanding work and starts describing
  policy.

- Ruff, strict Ty and relaxed Ty are three graph steps rather than one opaque
  call around a function that ran them in sequence and gathered their failures
  into a list by hand. They are timed apart, a Ruff failure no longer hides
  what Ty would have said, and the plan aggregates independent failures the way
  it does everywhere else. Their policy is typed too: roots must be relative,
  unique and inside the checkout, strict roots must be a subset of the checked
  ones, and a ratchet entry must look like a `ty` rule -- `ty` ignores an
  unknown `--ignore`, so a misspelt entry held nothing back and looked exactly
  like a rule somebody had fixed.

- The scheduler reserves a step's contention claims before submitting it,
  rather than submitting everything and having each worker block inside the
  resource lock. A worker was previously occupied purely by waiting, so the
  pool had to be as large as the plan -- eighty-one threads for the candidate
  gate -- for the one step that could actually run to have somewhere to go.
  Parallelism is a configured bound now, and a step's outcome carries three
  numbers instead of one: how long it waited for its dependencies, how long it
  waited for a resource, and how long its own work took. A step that took
  twenty minutes because it queued nineteen of them behind Docker used to look
  exactly like a step doing twenty minutes of work.

- A run records what built it: where `capsem.gate` was imported from, and
  which isolated bytecode cache the interpreter ran under. `HEAD` and the
  source digest describe a checkout and say nothing about which code read
  them. The three waits also reach `run.jsonl` and the timing report, so a
  plan whose critical path is mostly queueing says so instead of looking slow.

- Whether two steps can be in flight together is one predicate, used by the
  plan validator, the scheduler and their tests. It was implemented twice, and
  the copies agreed with each other about the wrong answer.

### Fixed

- Failure-evidence bundles were quietly incomplete. `copy_small_file` returned
  the same silence for three different outcomes -- the file was absent, over
  the size cap, or unreadable -- and the IronBank globs matched nothing at all
  on a tree where those builds never ran, so a bundle could not distinguish
  "there was nothing to collect" from "the collector failed". Every bundle now
  carries a `collected.json` naming each source attempted and what became of
  it, globs included when they match nothing.

  The first bundle written with that manifest reported `build.log` and
  `docker-storage.jsonl` as over the cap -- meaning every previous bundle had
  silently omitted the two files a post-mortem reaches for first, and did so
  precisely on the long runs that needed them. Oversized files are now tailed
  rather than dropped, because the end of a build log is where the failure is.

- A fresh clone now plans the same gate a warm tree does. The functional
  module asked for its profile axis while the plan was being *built*, and that
  read `target/config/profiles` -- build output -- so the same commit produced
  one plan on a developer's machine and another on a clean checkout. A release
  passed a 57-minute gate locally on leftovers, pushed, dispatched, and CI
  failed with 94 tests all reporting `no materialized profiles found`. Neither
  `source.record` nor `source.verify` could have caught it: they digest tracked
  source, and this input was not tracked source. The axis comes from checked-in
  `config/profiles/` now. The agreement it used to check inline -- materialized
  against declared against source -- did not go away; it became a step, which
  is where a question about build output can actually be asked.

- A gate now reports what it did to the filesystem, as it does it. `contends`
  is a list an author typed and the overlap check compares two such lists to
  each other -- nothing in that loop had ever looked at a disk, so a step that
  did not mention what it touched satisfied every check by saying nothing, and
  the writer was frequently a unit test three subprocesses down. Two sources
  feed it now: the in-process primitives are proxied, so the caller and the
  state *before* the call are both known exactly, and a `watchdog` observer
  covers what subprocesses do. Faults land on stderr the minute they occur, in
  a size-capped log beside the run that survives a `kill -9`, and in the run
  log. It names hardlinks between checked-in source and build output, modes
  that change and change back, source writable beyond its owner, artifacts that
  end a run empty, identical bytes under two names, and two concurrent steps
  touching one path neither declared.

- `release-profile` reached the step before publishing and refused, because
  `tested-head` was empty: four contracts that run a release plan to read back
  its argv had overwritten the running gate's record of the revision under
  test. Same defect as the source state, and the fix for that one did not
  reach here -- it taught the `Action` subclasses to check whether the plan was
  being read or run, and `RecordHead` writes through the `write_text` helper
  instead. The guard has been widened from one file to the set a run records
  its identity in, so the next instance fails by name in seconds rather than
  an hour into a release.

- A fresh install materialized one profile's images and reported success. A
  channel's profiles own their images, so the release graph gives each its own
  asset release and the channel pointer can name at most one of them -- but
  both the local-copy and the download path resolved that single pointer and
  fetched only its assets. Installing a channel whose profiles pin different
  kernels left the others' absent, and the profile that sorted first became an
  unbootable default. Once profile-suffixed release keys existed it got
  sharper still: the resolver could pick a profile whose asset names differ
  and fail the install outright.

  Both paths now ask one function what this architecture needs, across every
  compatible release. It keys by logical name *and* hash, because two profiles
  legitimately ship a different `vmlinuz` and keying by name alone silently
  keeps one of them -- the same missing-kernel install, reintroduced by the
  fix for it.

- Reading a gate plan no longer runs it. `tests/helpers/gate.py` reads back the
  argv a command would issue by *running* its plan against a recording runner,
  which stubs subprocesses and nothing else -- so every filesystem action ran
  for real, against the real checkout, while a gate might be holding it. The
  step that writes down the HEAD and source digest under test wrote them with
  the recorder's empty output, and forty minutes later `source.verify` compared
  that against reality and reported

      source HEAD changed while the gate was running:  -> <head>

  for a tree nobody had touched. A context now says whether its plan is being
  read or run, and every primitive that touches the machine asks -- rather than
  each action deciding for itself, which the next one to write a file would not
  remember to do.

  That also makes an observation reach the whole plan. A step's declared
  artifacts are hashed once its actions run, and nothing built them because
  nothing ran, so `Hash` raised `cannot hash ...: it is not a file` and the
  observation ended at the first step claiming an output. Every contract
  reading back issued argv was reading a prefix of the plan.

  The release fail-stop contract was the one actually corrupting the gate: it
  runs real release plans against the real checkout to prove a failing gate
  stops publication, and `source.record` sits ahead of the step it fails on.
  It reads its plans now instead of running them, and `tests/conftest.py`
  fails any test that rewrites the state file -- by name, in seconds, with the
  file put back -- rather than letting a gate discover it forty minutes later
  and blame git.

- The recipe suite no longer launches a recipe whose graph takes the machine
  lock from inside a run that is holding it. `just doctor` depends on
  `_pnpm-install`, which dispatches to an exclusive command, so the child
  would have waited out its full timeout for a lock only its own parent could
  release -- the deadlock the composition model exists to prevent, refused by
  name. The claim splits where the architecture does: the dispatch is read
  from the justfile, and the half that can actually fail runs in-process. The
  same suite asserted a detached service by looking for `nohup` and `3>&-` in
  a recipe body; that is `Launch` now, and the assertion moved with it.

- `capsem-gate gc` no longer deletes the run it is writing. It reclaims
  `target/gate-runs` and records into it, which were compatible only while
  `gc` recorded nothing -- and a command that removes whole trees is exactly
  the one whose evidence is worth keeping, so it was made to record. The next
  journal write then failed with `FileNotFoundError` and the command could not
  complete at all. The run history is bounded by its own retention policy;
  `ensure_space` already excluded it, and this was the caller that did not.

- The IronBank ledger fixture no longer asks a content classifier for an
  answer its own payload makes ambiguous. It uploaded `upload:<random hex>`
  into a `.txt` file and asserted `text/plain`; the listing's mime comes from
  Magika, which classifies by content and deliberately does not let the
  extension vote, and a short `key: value` line is the shape of a CSS
  declaration or a CSV record. So the answer depended on the nonce -- one
  complete gate got `text/css` -- and the test was intermittent on a boundary
  it was not written to test. The payload is prose now, and a reproduction
  with a pinned nonce lives beside the detection it is about.

- The complete local gate can finish on macOS. Its last step required the
  native Tart glow-up report -- correctly, since a macOS host cannot boot a
  guest inside the Linux install container, so that proof stands in for it --
  and looked for it only in `CAPSEM_MACOS_NATIVE_GLOWUP_REPORT`, which nothing
  set. The report's path has been declared in `[modules]` the whole time and
  the step immediately before writes it exactly there, so every complete local
  gate failed at its very last step with "requires the native glow-up report
  from this module" while the report sat where configuration said it would.
  The variable still wins, because a release lane produces the report in
  another job; absent both, the refusal stands, which is the case it was
  written for.

- A VM on a long run directory boots again. `capsem-process` derived the run
  directory for its terminal socket by walking two levels up from its own IPC
  socket -- correct while that socket is `{run}/instances/{id}.sock`, and wrong
  the moment it is shortened to `/tmp/capsem/<hash>.sock`, which is exactly the
  long run directory the shortening exists for. Walking up gave `/tmp`, whose
  `instances/` does not exist, so the bind failed with `No such file or
  directory` inside the async loop and the VM never became exec-ready. The run
  directory is passed explicitly now, and `terminal_socket_path` creates the
  directory for whichever form it returns -- only the fallback branch did, and
  the preferred one trusted somebody else to have made it.

- A half-exported release environment no longer takes the diagnostics down
  with it. Parsing the release state in every command's constructor meant
  `runs last`, `logs`, `version` and `gc --dry-run` refused with the same
  message as the gate itself -- which is correct for a command that would
  *prove* something and useless for one that only reports, at exactly the
  moment an operator is trying to find out what the broken workflow did.
  Commands whose plan depends on the answer declare it.

- The release state is a discriminated union, so its illegal shapes are
  unrepresentable rather than merely unreachable. A dataclass with four
  optional fields let a local run carry an input directory perfectly happily
  and kept the invariant inside one parsing function; the path and profile
  values are validated as text at the boundary, and never against the
  filesystem -- a `--dry-run` that stats the disk depends on the machine it is
  only describing.

- Ctrl-C stops the gate instead of scheduling a stop. The plan runner held its
  thread pool through a `with` block, and that context manager's exit joins
  every running future -- an interrupt fifty milliseconds into a 750ms action
  returned after 756ms, and against a real copy or image assembly the operator
  watches nothing happen for minutes. Returning immediately would be worse: the
  machine lock, the workspace and the service are released on the way out, and
  releasing them under a worker still writing turns an interrupt into
  corruption. So it is cooperative: pending steps are cancelled, waiters are
  woken, the long filesystem and hashing primitives give up at their next safe
  boundary, and the run waits a bounded ten seconds before naming whatever is
  still going.

- A run directory now holds what its commands printed. `RunLog.step_log()`
  existed, the module documentation promised a log per step, and no production
  code called it -- a real recorded `release-binaries` run in this checkout had
  a `steps/` directory with zero files in it, so compiler, pytest, Docker and
  script output survived only as terminal scrollback. Output is teed by the
  funnel now: filed against whichever step is running, streamed live so a long
  gate is still distinguishable from a hung one, and a failed command repeats a
  configured tail of its own output in the error. The log is line-buffered, so
  a running step can be read while it runs and a hard-killed one keeps what it
  had printed. The cost is deliberate -- output goes through a pipe, so
  children no longer see a TTY.

- A run records the invocation it was given. `RunStart` was reconstructed from
  the parsed namespace by looking for a field named `argv` that almost no
  command declares, so `release-binaries nightly` was recorded as
  `['release-binaries']` and a failed release could not say which channel it
  had attempted.

- A run's directory is protected from the moment it exists until its summary is
  written. It was created before the marker that says "being written" was
  taken, and the marker was dropped before `run.end` and the summary were
  written -- two windows in which another command allocating its own run could
  classify this one as crashed and rotate it away, the second of them after a
  release had already published.

- Duplicate artifact producers are accepted only when they truly serialize. The
  guard intersected contention *names*, so two steps both claiming one resource
  in `shared` mode -- a readers-lock, designed to overlap -- passed validation
  and were free to overwrite one path concurrently. The test repeated the same
  name-only algorithm, so it agreed with the bug.

- Retention measures each surviving run once instead of re-walking every
  remaining tree on every removal pass.

- The gate can no longer qualify stale bytecode. CPython validates a `.pyc`
  against the source's mtime and size, so two edits of the same length inside
  one timestamp tick leave bytecode that still looks current -- during a review
  of the gate that produced 74 identical false failures naming something the
  source no longer contained, and an isolated cache made them vanish with no
  source change. That is not just bad local feedback: `just test` and both
  release commands start with `uv run capsem-gate`, and the source guard
  records a digest of the bytes on disk rather than the bytes the interpreter
  is running. `capsem-gate` now re-execs under a per-invocation
  `pycache_prefix` before importing any of the gate, exports it so pytest and
  every other child inherit the same isolation, and the complete gate refuses
  in its first step if it was not started that way.

- Every `just` recipe argument now crosses exactly one argv boundary. `just`
  interpolates `{{value}}` into the recipe body as shell *source*, so
  `just build 'debug; rm -rf ~'` ran the payload before any Python saw it. The
  release selectors were quoted; `build`, `build-all`, `_build-ui`,
  `_cross-compile` and the CI-facing asset primitives were not, and
  `justfile_directory()` was unquoted in two places, so a checkout under a path
  with a space was not portable. Manual double quotes are not a fix -- `$(...)`
  and backticks still expand inside them -- which is why `build` and
  `build-all` looked safe and were not. The boundary test now discovers every
  parameter from `just --dump` instead of a hand-written list of five, and
  asserts the argv a real shell builds rather than whether a quote appears
  somewhere on the line. `just dev`'s variadic passthrough is gone: `just`
  joins a variadic before interpolating it, so no spelling preserves argument
  boundaries -- `uv run capsem-gate dev tui …` is the one that can.

- A partial release environment can no longer build a hybrid proof. Three gate
  modules each decided independently whether they were in a release lane --
  the artifact module from `CAPSEM_RELEASE_INPUT_DIR`, the functional module
  from the same one, the glow-up module from `CAPSEM_RELEASE_PACKAGE` -- and
  nothing compared their answers. Exporting only the input directory built a
  plan that verified manifest-selected assets and then rebuilt the package from
  source; exporting only the package did the mirror image. Both are green, both
  cost a full gate, and both prove source bytes in place of the bytes that
  ship. One dropped `GITHUB_ENV` line was enough. The state is now one
  indivisible value with exactly three legal shapes -- local, binary release,
  profile release -- read once per run and passed down, and every partial
  combination is refused during plan construction with both sides named.

- Internal environment protocols have one owner. `[environment]` named
  `CAPSEM_HOME` and `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR`, and seven modules spelled those and
  thirteen others again as dictionary keys -- invisible to the guard that
  watches for literal environment *reads*, and exactly as hard to rename. The
  guard inspects writes now too, with an explicit allowlist for standard
  process and tool conventions: `HOME` and `TMPDIR` mean what they mean
  everywhere, and moving them into TOML would be dumping strings rather than
  giving a protocol an owner.

- Every remaining `Call` says why it is opaque to a dry run. Twenty of them
  shared one rationale -- "a package build carries signing material" -- which
  is true of exactly one, and a reason that covers everything is not a reason.
  `Why.SECRETS`, `Why.DYNAMIC` and `Why.COMPUTATION` are required now, a
  contract holds the first to the single phase that earns it, and the third is
  named to look weak because work that only decides or reports can usually be
  a declared action with its own render and its own timing.

- Hashing a declared artifact is bracketed like every other action, so the time
  it takes appears in the timing report instead of vanishing into its step.

### Removed

- Ten `justfile` values nothing read (`binary`, `cli_binary`, `service_binary`,
  `process_binary`, `mcp_binary`, `gateway_binary`, `admin_binary`,
  `host_binaries`, `assets_dir`, `entitlements`), the `output` parameter the
  four asset recipes accepted and never forwarded, the `_build-image-template`
  recipe left with no caller, and `_dev-tui`, which duplicated
  `capsem-gate dev tui` through a variadic that could not preserve its own
  arguments.

### Changed

- The service tests' profile-tree copy replaces an existing target and names
  every failure. `std::fs::copy` gives the destination the source's
  permissions and then refuses a destination that exists without write
  permission, so copying one tree twice into one place blocks itself. And the
  panic was a bare `Os { code: 13, kind: PermissionDenied }` with no path,
  which under parallel `nextest` in the Linux container produced an
  intermittent failure identifying neither the file nor the side of the copy.
  I could not reproduce it on demand -- this removes the mechanism I can see
  and makes any residual occurrence say what it touched.

- The terminal socket path goes through `capsem_core::uds`, which owns the
  `sun_path` length rule and which neither side was using. The gateway and
  `capsem-process` each built `{run_dir}/instances/{uuid}-ws.sock` by hand --
  54 bytes of fixed suffix, leaving about fifty for the run directory against
  macOS's 104. Past that every connection failed with `path must be shorter
  than SUN_LEN`, logged at ERROR on each retry (12,024 in one observed run) and
  surfaced as a session whose shell simply never appeared. The short form has
  to be deterministic because the two processes derive it independently and
  never exchange it, so it is a blake3 digest rather than the per-process
  `DefaultHasher` the existing fallback uses. The close frame now carries the
  concrete reason instead of "VM not available", which was true of every cause
  and pointed at none.

- The plan can express a phase that holds something against outsiders while
  its own lanes share it, and the asset build's `ThreadPoolExecutor` is gone.
  An exclusive was a `threading.Lock`, so declaring `docker_daemon` serialized
  the two architecture lanes -- which must overlap to fit the time budget --
  and not declaring it let any Docker step schedule beside them. `assetlanes`
  answered that with its own pool: concurrency the graph could not see, order
  against, time, or attribute a failure to, which is why it had to collect
  both failures by hand. A claim now carries a mode, shared or exclusive, and
  the scheduler holds a readers-writer lock per resource. The lanes are two
  steps in one wave holding Docker shared; the asset phase is five steps
  (`preflight`, both `build.<arch>`, `sweep`, `assemble`) instead of one call.
  Awaiting both lanes stops being a module's promise and becomes the
  scheduler's rule: two steps with no edge between them both run, and a
  failure skips only what depends on it.
- The release-channel contract asserts what an *absent* manifest looks like.
  Every case it covered was the manifest being wrong -- swapped, stale,
  mutated, digest-drifted -- and none was it being missing, which is the case
  that actually happens: the site serves its index page for any unknown path,
  so `GET /assets/nightly/manifest.json` answers `200` with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
  The validator already handled it, by fetching bytes and parsing rather than
  trusting a status code; nothing asserted that, so nothing would have caught
  it regressing. Mutation-tested: make the parse fall back to a stub and the
  new case goes red. A manifest that parses but is not an object is covered
  too, since valid JSON is not a valid manifest.

- `modules_bypassing_primitives` is deleted, not emptied. `assets`, `assetlanes`, `doctor`
  and `versions` went through the filesystem primitives, `doctor`'s entry-point
  probe went through the runner -- it called `subprocess.run` directly, so a
  doctor could report on a machine the run log never saw it touch -- and the
  file operations split into `filesystem.py`, with `crossexec.py` and
  `assetevidence.py` taking the questions that were never about building
  assets.

- The Linux package lane is eight steps instead of one opaque call. It was a
  single `Call` whose dry run printed one line of prose while six things
  happened: storage release, capacity, clock sync, asset sync, the docker
  build, package resolution, the proof, and reclaim. So `--dry-run` was blind
  for the gate's most expensive phase, twenty minutes of work carried one
  duration, and a failure named the whole rail -- which is how an exit-125 came
  to need a 25 MB log to locate. Every storage-ordering defect in that file
  came from having to reason about those phases from outside the box. Proven by
  behaviour rather than by plan text, since the plan changes on purpose: the
  same seven commands in the same order, captured against a recording runner
  before and after. `crosscompile.py` is the first module to leave
  `modules_bypassing_primitives`; its file operations go through the primitive
  module, while the build itself keeps a `Call` because its argv carries
  signing material that `--dry-run` must never print.

- The package rail's capacity checks measure two different moments. The pair
  exists because the builder image is itself part of what fills that rail --
  one check once it exists, one before the build spends the headroom -- and
  both calls sat on adjacent lines, so the second could only ever agree with
  the first. Two contracts asserted the count without noticing they were
  adjacent; deleting one looked right and would have lost a real check.
- `packageinputs.py` holds what a package build is *told* -- the pinned
  toolchain, the channel, the builder environment -- as pure functions, so a
  rename in `config/gate.toml` fails a unit test rather than producing a
  package built against the wrong manifest. `assets/current` is synced through
  the removal primitive instead of `rm -rf` and `cp -r` built from Python
  strings, which is the one shape the reclaimer guards exist to prevent and
  showed up in no dry run.

- The artifact contract has real producers. `Step.produces` drove both the
  per-step hashing into the run log and the "one owner per artifact" check, and
  no production step supplied it -- so `Hash` had no caller through that
  mechanism, every run log recorded zero artifacts, and the ownership check
  iterated an empty set. A guard that is green because it was asked nothing is
  worse than no guard. The signed host binaries, the cross-compiled guest
  agents, the repacked initrd and the source-state record declare their outputs
  at the fragment that builds them, so both release lanes inherit the claim.
  With real data the check reports what it always should have: three signing
  steps write the same binaries, which is safe only because they contend for
  one exclusive -- and that is now asserted rather than assumed.

- The recorded revision survives the checkouts a release is actually cut from.
  `head_revision` parsed `.git/HEAD` and then a loose ref by hand, which
  returns nothing for a linked worktree -- where `.git` is a *file* -- and
  nothing for a packed ref. Both recorded an empty revision, silently, so a
  timing or artifact comparison could be against a revision nobody knows. It
  asks git now. The test named after the linked-worktree case took `tmp_path`
  and ignored it, running against the ordinary checkout instead; it builds a
  real worktree, a real packed-ref repository, and a tree with no git at all.
- A live run cannot be rotated away by one that starts after it. Allocation,
  rotation and the `latest` pointer were uncoordinated, and every candidate for
  eviction is unfinished -- because unfinished is what a running gate looks
  like. Under a tight retention cap the oldest live run is the first thing
  reached for. Each run now holds a lock file for its length, so retention can
  tell "being written" from "crashed"; the three operations that touch another
  run's directory are serialized on a short-lived history lock, deliberately
  not the machine lock, which is held for a whole gate and would make opening a
  run log wait for one.

- One file owns one responsibility. `release.py` claimed the two release
  commands and also held the development surfaces and the guest entry points;
  they are `devloop.py` and `guestcommands.py` now. `vmmodules.py` held three
  independently composed release phases, which is three reasons for one file to
  change; they are `module_artifacts.py`, `module_functional.py` and
  `module_glowup.py`, re-exported so composition keeps one import site. Purely
  mechanical: `candidate`, `release-binaries` and `release-profile` render
  byte-identical dry-run and graph output before and after, which is the guard
  this kind of move deserves.

- Deployment data has one owner, and the guard that was supposed to enforce
  that can now see the shapes it was missing. It walked flat strings, so a path
  built with `/` was inspected as separate components and none of them looked
  like a path -- `Path(root) / "private" / "tauri" / "capsem.key"` passed
  cleanly. And an environment variable name is not a path at all, so nothing
  looked at `os.environ.get("CAPSEM_INSTALL_MANIFEST_URL")`, which is exactly
  the deployment data this rule exists for. Both are checked now, with the
  bootstrap exemption honoured and the checks watched failing on the shapes
  they exist for. What moved: the Tauri signing paths and variable names into
  `[package.signing]`; the package rail's three inputs into `[package]`; the
  install profile-inputs variable into `[install]`; `CAPSEM_HOME`,
  `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR` and the benchmark and coverage names into `[environment]`,
  where Workspace exports and Service reads the same ones rather than each
  spelling its own; and the three bootable asset filenames into `[artifacts]`,
  which two config lists and `initrd.py` had spelled independently. The macOS
  report variable was already declared and `install.py` spelled it again.
- `packagesigning.py` owns whether a checkout can sign and under what names.
  It was a function inside the package rail, which is a different question from
  how a package is built -- and it pushed that module past the 300-line ceiling
  the boundary guard holds.

- Resources run through the same guarded, journaling runner as the plan.
  `execute` built one for the plan's context and then constructed resources
  from the command's raw runner, so everything a resource did on the way in or
  out -- the orphan baseline, Colima, the service launch, the failure-evidence
  capture -- emitted no `exec` event and skipped the nested-gate refusal. The
  one code path that runs *while the machine lock is held* was the one path
  allowed to start a second gate, and a resource failure could leave no trace
  of the command that caused it.
- A detached launch is recorded. `GuardedRunner.launch` refused re-entry and
  delegated, so a daemon appeared in no run at all -- which is exactly the
  process the orphan count later has to account for. `launch` is now an event
  of its own, with argv, cwd, environment delta, pid and time-to-spawn; it is
  not an `exec`, because nothing waited for it and there is no exit status to
  report.

- Every consumer of a run agrees with what `run.end` recorded. `Timing.outcome`
  already treated a failed run as failed, and nothing read it: the summary, the
  run list and `runs last --failed` each classified by failed *steps*, so a run
  that failed while taking the machine lock, acquiring a resource or tearing
  one down was reported and selected as a success -- exactly the failures that
  are hardest to diagnose. The summary also names them now, rather than
  colouring the line red with no cause to act on.
- Whether a command records a run depends on how it was invoked. `gc` was a
  class constant `records = False`, with "only reads runs" copied from the run
  readers, while it reclaims whole trees -- so a partial reclaim left terminal
  output and no durable evidence. `gc --dry-run` is inspection; any other `gc`
  records. The guard asks an invocation instead of approving a command by name.
- `--timing` on a command that records no run says so instead of raising
  `AttributeError: 'NullJournal' object has no attribute 'directory'`, which is
  what `version --timing`, `runs --timing` and `gc --dry-run --timing` did.

- Public recipe arguments can no longer become host shell syntax.
  `release-binaries`, `release-profile` and `logs` interpolated their values
  into the recipe body unquoted, and `just release-binaries 'nightly; echo X'`
  ran `echo X` on the host. Python could never contain this: the shell parses
  the recipe before the gate receives an argument. `dev` was worse -- it built
  the *recipe name* from input, which quoting cannot fix -- so it dispatches to
  the `dev` command, which already validates the three surfaces.
- Both release commands keep the host awake again. Keep-awake belonged to
  `candidate` because the gate belonged to `candidate`; the releases reached it
  by launching `just test`. Deleting that child was right, and left them owning
  the same forty-minute qualification with none of the wrapper, so an
  unattended macOS release could sleep through its own publication. A
  `CompleteGate` mixin owns the wrapper and the gate's resources, and the guard
  states the policy -- everything containing the complete gate -- rather than
  naming one command, which is why the old one stayed green through the gap.

- An install retry can no longer change where the product comes from. The
  postinst dropped the manifest handoff from an `EXIT` trap, so a failing
  `dpkg -i` consumed it and the `apt-get install -f -y` that immediately
  follows hydrated from the public channel instead. The reported error then
  named production while the real failure was local -- and a retry that
  happened to succeed would have had the gate qualify an install of something
  nobody handed it. The handoff is now cleared on success only, by the writer
  that owns it, and the install proof reads back the source the postinst
  recorded and refuses anything but the channel it handed over. Silence is
  refused too: an install that recorded no source cannot be qualified.

- The update fixtures read the compatibility floor from `Cargo.toml` instead of
  restating it. They said `min_capsem_version = "1.0.0"`, which every profile
  satisfied while the workspace was 1.x and none satisfied once it moved back
  to 0.6 -- so `capsem update` refused every catalog with "profile code
  requires Capsem 1.0.0 or newer, selected 0.6.0", and seven update-state tests
  failed as soon as the install proof got far enough to run them.
- `capsem-gate install` builds the image its Dockerfile derives from.
  `build_system/docker/Dockerfile.install-test` is `FROM capsem-host-builder:latest`, and
  the lane's plan was a single step, so it only worked when an earlier phase of
  a larger plan had left that tag behind. Run on its own -- or on any machine
  where the previous run released it at `after-install` -- it failed with
  `pull access denied`. The release contract requires every module to own its
  prerequisites and be runnable in a clean environment; a guard holds it now.

- A `file://` release channel resolves its artifacts against its own dist root
  rather than the filesystem root. A generated channel is a website: the
  manifest sits at `<root>/assets/<channel>/manifest.json` and records its
  artifacts site-root-relative, as `/profiles/releases/...`. Over https that is
  exactly right, because the site root is the origin. Resolved against a
  `file://` manifest the whole path was replaced, producing
  `file:///profiles/releases/...` -- the filesystem root -- so every hydration
  of a locally built channel failed with ENOENT. The gate's install proof hands
  the postinst exactly such a channel, so the candidate gate could not install
  the package it had just built, and the `apt-get install -f` retry then
  reported a 404 against the public channel that nobody had asked it to use.

- The install proof's container mounts `/tmp` and `/run` with `exec`. Docker's
  default tmpfs flags are `rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec`, and the proof unpacks the
  shipped package into `/tmp` to run its `capsem-admin` -- deliberately, so the
  release graph is authored by the exact binary being shipped. On a noexec
  mount `test -x` returns false, and `test` prints nothing when it says no, so
  the gate failed after fifty-three minutes with an exit status and no
  explanation. The Linux-Rust container had already spelled its tmpfs out for
  the same reason; this is the other one.

- `last_consumer` in `config/storage-policy.toml` is load-bearing instead of
  decorative. `capsem-host-builder` declared `last_consumer = "package-x86_64"`
  and `reason = "Final tag is needed by both package builds"`, then also listed
  an `after-linux-rust-builder` boundary that released it before either --
  `package.arm64` died with docker exit 125 thirty-seven minutes into a run.
  The shell survived it because the cross-compile lane rebuilt the image;
  composed into one plan, `hostimage.fragment` is `plan.shared` and runs once,
  so an early release is simply destruction. The extra boundary is gone, and a
  guard now fails when any resource is reclaimed before the step its own policy
  names as its last consumer. Its real last consumer turned out not to be a
  package build at all: `build_system/docker/Dockerfile.install-test` is `FROM
  capsem-host-builder:latest` and the install proof always rebuilds -- on
  purpose, so a stale tag cannot hide a new prerequisite -- so releasing at
  `after-packages` broke `glowup.install` with `pull access denied` fifty-three
  minutes in. The tag is released at `after-install`, and the `after-packages`
  boundary, which held nothing else, is gone.
- The parity lane's build tree is released at all. That boundary held one
  resource, so removing it left the phase empty and the phase went too -- which
  surfaced that the contract asserting "the build tree is handed back before
  the assets need room" was asserting on the builder *image*'s phase, a
  different resource. `capsem-linux-rust-target` was therefore never released,
  and the asset build ran with its space still held.

- `test_double_slash_in_path` asks the gateway for a status code rather than a
  JSON body. It had been rewritten from a vacuous `assert resp is not None or
  True` into `assert resp is not None` plus `resp.status_code < 500` -- but the
  test client returns parsed JSON or `None`, never anything with a
  `status_code`, and a 404 (the most likely correct answer for `//vms/list`)
  has no body at all. The claim was always "the gateway answered rather than
  died"; `get_raw` is what answers it.

- The asset lane creates its VM run directory where `config/gate.toml` says
  to. `run_dir_template = "/tmp/capsem-a.XXXXXX"` exists because AF_UNIX paths
  must fit macOS's 104-byte `sun_path` once the gateway appends
  `instances/<uuid>-ws.sock`, but the code used the template's *name* as an
  `mkdtemp` prefix and dropped its parent -- so the directory landed in
  `$TMPDIR`, which on macOS is `/var/folders/<11>/<24>/T/` and spends 57 bytes
  before anything else. Every terminal connection failed with `path must be
  shorter than SUN_LEN`, 12,024 times in one gate run, while the VM sat at a
  healthy prompt the TUI could never display and the shell proof timed out
  reporting only that no prompt appeared.

- Storage a later step still needs is no longer reclaimed by an earlier one.
  `install-image` ended by releasing the linux-rust builder rail, and 164ms
  later `cache-ownership` ran that exact image and got exit 125. Four rails
  were handed back from two places each -- once as a properly ordered step, and
  once as a statement inside some other step's body where nothing could order
  it. In the shell those statements were ordered by the line they sat on; once
  the preflight moved ahead of the parity lane, the accident stopped holding.
  The statements are gone; the steps own their rails, and the contract that
  watched the old arrangement now asserts the edge instead of the line.
- `all_guest_binaries_in_pack_initrd` reads `[initrd] binaries` from
  `config/gate.toml` rather than the `cp`/`chmod` lines of a recipe that no
  longer packs anything. Same claim, against the list that now decides it.
- `event-listener` 5.4.1 -> 5.4.2, clearing RUSTSEC-2026-0221 (`!Send` tags
  crossing thread boundaries via `StackSlot`), which reached the workspace
  through zbus under the Tauri plugins.

- A gate command started from inside a gate run is refused instead of
  deadlocking. `GuardedRunner` sees a *subprocess* that re-enters the gate, but
  not a `cli.main([...])` called from Python inside a process the gate itself
  launched -- and the gate launches pytest, whose suite did exactly that. The
  worker blocked on the lock its own grandparent held, for the full
  7200-second timeout, with the run looking alive throughout. The machine lock
  now exports `CAPSEM_GATE_RUN` like any other resource environment, so every
  descendant can tell it is inside a run, and an exclusive command that finds
  it fails in milliseconds saying what to do instead. Read-only commands are
  unaffected: asking `runs last` what a running gate is doing is the point of
  `runs last`.
- The gate CLI's dispatch tests drive the parser and the plan rather than
  `execute()`. What they assert is that argv reaches the right primitive with
  the right arguments, which never needed the machine lock.

- The last 12 contracts that read gate behaviour out of `justfile` text now
  read it off the gate: `tests/helpers/gate.py` builds any command's plan and
  runs it against a recording runner, so a claim like "both dependency audits
  run in parallel and neither hides the other" is asserted as two steps with
  the same predecessors instead of as two `&` and a `wait` in a recipe body.
  Nine test files shared eight copies of that helper; there is one now, cached,
  which also took a minute off the contract suite.
- `test_release_channel_contract_suite_is_in_pr_and_local_gates` asserted
  `... or True`, which is not an assertion. The suite *is* ignored by the broad
  pytest run, deliberately -- the release-contracts phase owns it -- so that is
  what the contract says now.

- `GateCommand.execute` now enforces the rules every command used to be trusted
  to remember, and all three were being broken. A plan action may no longer
  invoke `just` or another `capsem-gate` subcommand: the machine lock is not
  reentrant, so each such call was a child waiting out its timeout for the lock
  its own parent held, and the static guard finds 22 of them across 9 modules.
  Every subprocess is recorded by the runner rather than by whatever wanted the
  command, which is why `RunLog.exec` had no production caller at all and no
  run log held a single command. And plan construction runs with the machine
  sealed, so `--dry-run` cannot touch it. The seal is ambient rather than a
  property of one runner, because `release.py` built its own `Runner` inside
  `plan()` to capture `git rev-parse HEAD` -- the dry run printed a real
  revision while nothing recorded that anything had run.
- Resources contribute their environment through the lifecycle protocol, and
  `execute` folds what was acquired into the context. `Workspace.environment`
  existed and production never read it, so every command advertised as isolated
  was in fact running against the developer's own `~/.capsem`.
- Inspection is decided before any re-exec, so `--dry-run` and `--graph` can no
  longer become a real run. Previously `candidate --dry-run` on macOS re-execed
  into `just test`: an inert question starting a forty-minute destructive gate.
- The revision a release publishes is captured by a step rather than read while
  the plan was being built, so the value comes from the run instead of from
  whenever the description happened to be assembled.
- Every gate run now writes a record: an event stream, a log per step, and a
  summary, under `target/gate-runs/<id>/` with `latest` pointing at the most
  recent. Diagnosing a failure used to require having been present when it
  happened -- which command ran with which arguments, what it exited with,
  where the time went, which bytes came out all lived in a terminal, for
  whoever was watching. Every line is validated against a model on the way
  out, so the log cannot drift into a shape nothing reads back. `exec` records
  only the environment a command *added*, never the ambient one, because this
  file gets attached to bug reports and a release machine's environment holds
  tokens. Rotation is bounded by both count and bytes, and gives up completed
  runs before crashed ones -- a crashed run is precisely the case where the
  terminal output was lost with it.
- `just exec` works, and no longer lets guest text run on the host. Three
  independent defects met in one command. The CLI subparser stored the
  subcommand name in `command` and `ExecCommand` stored its payload there too,
  so argparse overwrote the name and dispatch raised `TypeError: cannot use
  'list' as a dict key` -- the public command could not run at all. The recipe
  interpolated `{{CMD}}` unquoted, so `just exec 'echo guest; echo HOST'`
  rendered a second *host* command: text a user believes is going into a
  sandbox executed outside it. And it invoked `capsem exec`, which executes in
  an existing session and takes one, rather than `capsem run`, which is the
  one-shot fresh session the recipe documents. The payload is now one exact
  string, quoted by `just` and passed after `--`, so a leading dash stays a
  payload rather than becoming a flag.
- The configuration is validated for meaning, not only shape. Pydantic rejected
  unknown keys but accepted any integer, so `version = 2` loaded happily and was
  then read with the wrong meaning, and `keep_runs = 0` pruned the run being
  written -- surfacing as a missing directory rather than as the bad policy it
  was. The schema version is a literal and the retention bounds are on the
  types.
- Guest-binary freshness stopped guessing from `*.rs` mtimes. A dependency bump,
  a feature change or a toolchain bump leaves every source file older than the
  staged binary while the binary is stale, and a stale guest binary ships into
  an initrd that does not match the source it claims to be built from.
  `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `build.rs` and the toolchain pin are inputs now.
- Mutating commands hold the machine lock. `sign`, `build-ui`, `install-tools`,
  `install-node` and `test-release-contracts` all write something another
  process could be reading, and none of them took it. Per-step
  `[execution.exclusives]` are `threading.Lock`s -- they order steps inside one
  plan and coordinate nothing between two `capsem-gate` processes, so `just
  _sign` in one terminal could replace the codesigned binaries a qualification
  in another was executing. Only genuine inspection is non-exclusive now, and
  the guard names each one with its reason.
- An empty artifact stops counting as a built one. `imagebuild.missing` asked
  `is_file()`, so a zero-length `vmlinuz` -- which is what a build that ran out
  of disk leaves -- satisfied the check meant to catch exactly that.
- `release-profile` refuses an unknown channel or profile before the gate
  rather than after it. `release-binaries` already validated its channel; the
  asymmetry cost a complete run to learn something knowable in milliseconds.
- A run log can now be trusted, which is the whole reason it exists. Step
  attribution was one mutable string on the `RunLog`, and the plan runs
  independent steps concurrently -- so whichever step started last owned every
  action, note, artifact and subprocess any of them emitted. Each write was
  mutex-protected, which made the *lines* correct and the *attribution* wrong;
  a record that confidently blames the wrong step is worse than no record. It
  is a `ContextVar` now, which the worker threads inherit.
- A run that failed outside every step is no longer reported as passing. The
  machine lock, a resource that would not acquire and a teardown that raised
  all live outside a step, so classifying by steps alone called a run whose
  every step passed and whose workspace then refused to release a success.
- The summary is written when the run closes rather than when somebody asks
  for `--timing`, so the run nobody asked about still leaves something a bug
  report can attach -- which is exactly the run that needs one. Run ids carry a
  random suffix, because they had one-second resolution and the machine lock is
  taken *after* the log is opened, so two contenders collided on the way in.
- `runs` and `gc` no longer record themselves. `runs last --failed` opened a
  run and repointed `latest` at itself before answering, so the honest answer
  to "which run failed" could be the question.
- `just smoke` starts. `SmokeCommand` declared a `Service` resource whose
  `acquire` raised unconditionally, so the command died on acquisition every
  time -- after the recipe had already paid for the fast checks and the runtime
  preparation. Underneath that was the ownership mistake the raise stood in
  for: the service resolved `CAPSEM_HOME` from the ambient environment when it
  was constructed, so even a working acquire could have started a daemon in one
  place and stopped something else on the way out. It is built from the
  `Workspace` beside it now, and handed the runner rather than building one, so
  "which service" and "which home" cannot drift apart and a recording runner
  can see the launch.
- Isolation actually reaches commands. `Workspace.environment` was a property
  while the `Resource` protocol calls it as a method, so folding an acquired
  workspace's environment into the context raised `TypeError: 'dict' object is
  not callable` against the one resource every isolated command holds. The
  funnel tests never caught it because they exercise a recorder written to
  match the protocol rather than the classes that implement it; a guard now
  checks every concrete `Resource` in the package, and the workspace's four
  variables by name.
- `CAPSEM_RELEASE_CHANNEL_DIST` meant two things and now means one.
  `loadReleaseData` read it to decide *what to render*; `overlay-dist.mjs` read
  it to decide *where to copy the built output*. Those are an input and an
  output, and nothing but convention kept a caller from setting one where the
  other was expected. `CAPSEM_RELEASE_GRAPH` is the input; the old name is the
  output directory and only that.
  The overload had grown a branch to survive itself: the overlay inspected its
  target and skipped its own work when the path turned out to be a *file*,
  because a file meant "graph fixture" -- the input meaning arriving at the
  output variable. That check is deleted with the ambiguity that required it.
  No compatibility path: both consumers are in this repository, so the rename
  lands atomically. Where one path genuinely plays both roles -- a generated
  distribution is both the graph rendered and the directory rendered into --
  callers set both names, and a guard requires them to be driving the command
  that does both halves rather than merely naming both.
- No plan action starts a second gate anywhere. The last three modules are
  composed: the asset lanes call the image builder directly, the package rail
  calls the Debian proof directly, and both release commands *contain* the
  complete gate rather than launching `just test`. Because both are exclusive,
  that launch could never have succeeded -- the child would have waited out its
  timeout for the lock its own parent held -- so "nothing publishes before the
  complete proof passes" was a promise no run could keep, and is now an edge.
  The ratchet tracking the remaining offenders is deleted rather than emptied:
  a list describing no remaining work reads as permission for some.
- Concurrent asset lanes stop overwriting each other. `_build-image-template`
  declared an `output` parameter and never forwarded it, so `capsem-admin`
  wrote into the one configured assets tree while each lane verified a private
  directory nothing had written. Every test walked past it because the fakes
  fabricated artifacts from the argv the *dispatcher* was handed, one layer
  above where the value was dropped; they key on the builder's own argv now.
- The three `CAPSEM_PROOF_*` variables are gone. They existed only to carry
  arguments across a process boundary that no longer exists, and `DebProof`
  always took them as arguments.
- `just test` is one process, one machine lock, one workspace and one plan --
  64 steps and 91 actions in a single graph, where it used to be a tree of
  exclusive commands each waiting out a 7200-second timeout for the lock its
  own parent held. The ordering that lived in three languages at once (`just`
  dependencies, the line order of a shell body, and four separate `plan()`
  methods) is now edges. Steps are namespaced by phase, so the run log and the
  timing report say which part of the gate a slow step belongs to.
- The two things that must happen even when the gate fails became resources
  rather than steps, because a step whose dependency failed is skipped -- which
  is right for work and wrong for cleanup. The orphan-process accounting is one
  (an aborted run is exactly the run whose survivors need counting), and so is
  the Colima lifecycle, which was a shell trap wrapping only the commands that
  happened to sit inside the wrapper. `with-gate-colima.sh` goes.
- A cleanup that cannot happen now says so. `Remove` used
  `shutil.rmtree(ignore_errors=True)`, so every removal succeeded on paper: a
  busy or unwritable path survived into the next qualification while the plan
  recorded the cleanup as done. Run-history rotation had the same shape and
  additionally reported reclaimed bytes that were still on the disk, so every
  later capacity decision was made against a wrong number. Absence is still the
  tolerable outcome -- teardown runs against whatever a failure left behind --
  but a refusal is a failure, and the path is now verified gone before success
  is recorded.
- A teardown failure no longer replaces the failure that caused it. `held`
  released resources in a `finally`, and an exception raised there *replaces*
  the one in flight -- so an operator was told a process had leaked and never
  learned which test failed and leaked it. Cleanup failures are now reported
  and attached to the primary error as a note, and only become the error
  themselves when there is no primary one to lose.
- The two VM-owned test modules compose the work they used to launch. The
  assets build, the install proof, the package builds, signing, the host SBOM,
  the install-test image, the Linux parity lane and every storage-release
  boundary were each a fresh `capsem-gate` or `just` process started from
  inside a plan whose command already held the machine lock. Composing them
  surfaced a real cycle immediately: the glow-up lane chains architectures so
  the second package build waits for the first to release its disk, and passing
  that ordering down to the shared builder image made the image depend on a
  package that depends on the image. Shared groundwork now takes no ordering
  from its caller -- only the work that runs inside it does.
- The Linux builder image is built again. `installimage.prepare()` and
  `CrossCompiler._prepare_builder()` both ran `just _build-host-image`, a recipe
  that carries a heading in the justfile and no body -- so install-image
  preflight and every cross-compiled package had been failing at that line, and
  with them static qualification and the package lanes. Both compose
  `hostimage.fragment()` now, which is `shared`, so several lanes in one plan
  build the six-gigabyte image once and hang off it. Their two ordering
  contracts moved from watching a runner issue a command to asserting the edge,
  because watching a runner cannot tell a command that ran from one that failed.
- The macOS keep-awake wrapper re-execs the operator's own invocation rather
  than `just test`, so the flags they passed survive and an already-dispatched
  command does not re-enter the dispatch chain from the top.
- Profile selection for a functional proof moved into `capsem.gate.profiles`,
  where a plan can be built from it without a subprocess. The base profile is
  named in config rather than by a sort key comparing against the string
  `code` inside a script -- a product decision that had been spelled as a
  lambda. `build_system/scripts/release/release-test-profiles.py` stays as the command-line surface
  CI already calls.
### Fixed

- A step that produces a fixed path must not share it with another producer
  that claims no common exclusive, and the plan now refuses to run when two
  do. A lock around the mutation is not a lock around the artifact: a step can
  hold an exclusive while it builds, release it, and hand back "look at this
  path" -- and the next claimant overwrites that path before the consumer
  reads it. An edge orders a consumer after *its* producer and says nothing
  about a second producer beside it.
- Web-surface builds now serialize on a declared `astro_build` exclusive.
  Astro stages prerendering in a path derived from the project root rather
  than the invocation, so neither `--outDir` nor `--cacheDir` isolates two
  concurrent builds and they delete each other's staging. The four surfaces do
  have distinct roots today, so this is insurance -- worth buying, because a
  build is under a second and the alternative is a rule that holds only until
  someone adds a second consumer of one root.
- `pnpm install` claims a `node_modules` exclusive: it rewrites a workspace
  in place and every web build reads it.
- `build_system/release_site/scripts/overlay-dist.mjs` takes its source directory as an
  argument instead of hardcoding Astro's default `outDir`, where a change to
  that setting would have broken the overlay silently.

### Changed

- New `/dev-gate` skill covering the gate's five layers, how to add a command,
  and every guard that will fail you. `/dev-just` now states the recipe rule as
  enforced rather than advised, and the docs point at `--dry-run` as the way to
  read what a recipe does -- since the recipe itself is now one line.
- The justfile no longer contains a shell body. It went from 2457 lines with
  roughly 2070 of inline `bash` across thirty-five recipes to 73 body lines
  across sixty-four, none over five, none with a shebang -- and the ratchet
  that tracked the outstanding extraction has been deleted rather than
  emptied, because a list describing no remaining work reads as permission for
  some. The ceiling is five lines and the inline-control-flow exception list
  is empty.
- Fourteen more recipes are dispatches: the image-build family (four recipes
  spelling out one `capsem-admin image build` invocation where only the
  template varied), the asset presence check (which hand-rolled a
  `uname -m | sed` architecture mapping that `config.arch` already owned), the
  toolchain installs, the Linux-Rust parity lane and its builder image, the
  host SBOM, signing, the desktop bundle build, log reading, and the dev
  surface selector. The justfile is 995 body lines to 336.
- `_test-candidate-run` is gone. All six modules `just test` is made of are
  commands now, each declaring the workspace it needs and the graph of steps it
  contains -- both answerable without running anything. A module used to be the
  text between two `if` statements selected by an environment variable, so
  running one in isolation meant exporting a variable and hoping. The justfile
  is 995 body lines to 593.
- pytest is invoked one way now. Sixteen call sites across two recipes each
  assembled their own flags and agreed by hand -- the same `--tb=short`, the
  same four `--ignore` directories, the same `CAPSEM_REQUIRE_ARTIFACTS=1` --
  which is sixteen chances for one to differ with nothing to notice which.
  More importantly, what may not share a machine is now declared rather than
  achieved by placement: the host-snapshot suites claim the single service,
  the benchmarks claim the Apple VZ launch budget, and the suites that rebuild
  the workspace claim the binaries a running VM test is using. In shell those
  held only because each sat below a `wait`.
- The fast gate is the first module ported out of `_test-candidate-run`, and
  it is now a graph rather than seven backgrounded jobs aggregating into one
  `FAIL` bit. Every failure comes back named. The one real dependency in it --
  clippy reads `web/app/dist`, which `capsem-app` embeds at compile time --
  is an edge instead of a conditional that used to skip clippy entirely when
  the frontend failed, losing that result on exactly the runs where the most
  had changed.
- The source-contract test inventory moved from 47 hand-maintained lines in
  the justfile into `config/gate.toml`, with a guard requiring every
  `tests/test_gate_*.py` to appear in it. Eleven had been added without
  reaching the list, so they ran in neither the fast module nor the exclusion
  that keeps them out of the VM matrix.
- The isolated gate home is one `Workspace` resource rather than three
  hand-written setups. `_test-candidate-run`, `smoke` and the asset gate each
  built the same thing with the same four exported variables and an EXIT trap,
  and each got slightly different details right -- while the details are the
  whole point. Two orderings are now structural instead of positional: the
  service stops before its run directory is removed, because stopping it is
  what flushes `serial.log`, and failure evidence is copied out before either,
  because both destroy it. The benchmark recordings are deliberately not
  cleared with the home; a module wiping them is why a fortnight of full gates
  left that directory empty and froze the published arm64 history.
- Every gate command now shares one lifecycle. A command declares what it
  holds and what work it contains; when to release, in what order steps run,
  whether it needs the machine to itself and how any of it is recorded are the
  same for all of them, and a contract test forbids a command from defining
  its own. That is what makes `--dry-run`, `--graph` and `--timing` exist on
  every command by construction rather than by each author remembering.
- Two new commands: `capsem-gate runs` reads a recorded run back -- list it,
  explain one, or jump to the last failure -- and `capsem-gate gc` reclaims
  the disk the gate is holding, replacing four scattered ways to clean up one
  of which a developer had to know to pick. Neither takes the machine lock,
  because asking what a run did is a question you should be able to ask while
  the next one is going.
- The gate now bounds and reclaims what it occupies. Every tree it can create
  is declared in `[disk] reclaimable`, nothing outside that may be removed,
  and `ensure_space` reclaims before refusing -- running out of disk an hour
  into a VM asset build wastes the hour and leaves a half-built tree the next
  run has to clear first. The removal refuses any path that resolves outside
  the checkout and unlinks symlinks rather than following them, so a link
  someone left pointing at their home directory costs them the link.
- A run now reports where its time went, and reports the right thing: the
  critical path, not the slowest step. Shortening a step that runs beside
  something longer changes nothing, so the number worth acting on is the
  longest chain that had to happen in order. Slow actions are named by what
  they invoked rather than by a label, and a failure is reported with the
  steps it took down with it. Computed from the recorded events, so the
  question can be asked about a finished run from a directory somebody
  attached to a bug report.
- Two gate runs can no longer start on one machine. A run's first act is to
  remove `$CAPSEM_HOME` and stop the service inside it, so a second run
  deletes the first's home mid-flight and both report failures belonging to
  neither. The lock is `flock`, not a pidfile: the kernel drops it when the
  holder dies, so a killed gate cannot wedge the machine and there is no
  staleness heuristic to get wrong. Contention names the holder -- what it is
  running, which pid, for how long -- instead of blocking mutely, and a
  missing or half-written holder record still reports the contention rather
  than an error about the record. All three subtleties the shell version
  carried in comments are now tests: the lockfile sits outside every tree the
  gate wipes, a daemon launched from a shell does not keep the lock alive
  after the gate dies, and the descriptor is explicitly non-inheritable.
- Gate ordering is declared as a dependency graph and derived by topological
  sort, rather than written out as a list whose order is its meaning. The
  install gate's defect was exactly this shape -- a manifest URL consumed
  before anything staged the file it pointed at -- and the fix was to move two
  lines, which no arrangement of source lines can now get wrong. A cycle is
  reported before any step runs, naming the steps involved. Whatever the sort
  makes simultaneously ready is independent by construction, so concurrency is
  no longer a human judgement about which jobs are safe beside each other;
  seven bare `&` in one recipe body were exactly that judgement, made once and
  never rechecked. Steps that are independent but still cannot share the
  machine declare what they contend for, and the plan serializes only those.
- Every gate command can now be asked what it would do without doing it.
  `--dry-run` prints the steps in execution order with the argv each would
  invoke and the contention each declares; `--graph` emits the same thing as a
  diagram. Both are free, which is the point: the question "what does `just
  test` actually do" previously cost forty minutes to answer.
- A failed step's dependents are reported as skipped rather than failed. They
  never ran, and a report that conflates the two hides how far the real failure
  reached. Independent failures are all reported together, so a broken gate
  takes one round to diagnose instead of three.
- Gate runs know their own critical path -- the longest chain of steps by
  measured duration, not the slowest single step. Shortening the slowest step
  does nothing when it runs beside something longer; the critical path is what
  a run's duration is actually made of.
- Exactly three gate modules may touch the machine directly: the filesystem
  primitives, the single funnel every invocation passes through, and the one
  place a signal is sent. Work that goes around them is work a dry run cannot
  show and a run log cannot time, so a contract test holds the line, with the
  not-yet-extracted modules on a ratchet that can only shrink. The same guard
  forbids `pkill`, `killall` and `pgrep` anywhere in the package: killing by
  process name cannot tell this run's daemons from the developer's own, and
  `_ensure-service` avoided it deliberately with nothing enforcing that.
- The initrd repack rule is enforced rather than remembered. The initrd is a
  hash-named file hardlinked into every asset tree built from the same bytes,
  so rewriting it in place rewrites all of them and the damage surfaces later
  as a VM that will not boot from a tree nobody touched. `_pack-initrd` avoided
  that by writing a scratch file and moving it; that is now an
  `AtomicReplace` primitive with a test that fails if the target is written
  directly.
- Gate work is built from reusable primitives rather than opaque callables. An
  action says what it would do and does it, and the two are independent, so
  `--dry-run` can print the argv a command would actually invoke instead of a
  list of step names, and a run can be timed below the step level. A context is
  handed to each action rather than closed over, which is what lets the same
  piece of work be reused by a command that sequences it differently.
- Gate teardown is a stack rather than a sequence of lines. `capsem.gate.held`
  acquires resources in order, releases them in reverse, and collects evidence
  on failure *before* releasing, because release is what destroys it. The two
  rules this replaces were both enforced only by where their `finally` lines
  happened to sit: the manifest handoff must clear before the install container
  goes, and the service must stop before its run directory is deleted, because
  stopping it is what flushes `serial.log`. A resource now declares its name at
  class definition, so forgetting it is an import error rather than a teardown
  message that says `resource` failed forty minutes in.
- The gate's policy for running *itself* is now declared in `config/gate.toml`
  rather than implied by shell: which work may not run beside which and why
  (`[execution.exclusives]`), who holds the machine (`[locks.gate]`), where a
  run is recorded (`[runlog]`), and how much disk it may occupy (`[disk]`).
  Each exclusive carries the reason it exists -- the Apple VZ launch budget,
  the single service-scoped snapshot lock, the binaries `cargo build` replaces
  underneath a running VM test. That knowledge previously lived in comments
  beside seven backgrounded jobs in `_test-candidate-run` and three more in
  `smoke`, where an eighth lane could violate a constraint recorded three
  hundred lines away.
- Reclaimable paths are validated at load: an entry that is absolute or
  escapes upwards fails with the offending value named. These are whole-tree
  removals, and the difference between a relative path and one aimed at the
  wrong tree is a single editing mistake.
- The gate's config schemas split by what they describe --
  `configschema` for the product being built, `harnessschema` for the gate
  running itself -- keeping both under the module ceiling the package enforces
  on its own source.

### Fixed

- Three `# noqa: BLE001` directives in `capsem.gate` suppressed a rule that is
  not enabled, so ruff reported each as an unused directive. The comments
  explaining why each `except` is deliberately broad are kept; the dead
  directives are gone.

- Build and release logic is moving out of the justfile and into
  `capsem.gate`, a unit-tested Python package the justfile dispatches to. The
  justfile held roughly 2070 lines of `bash` inside recipe bodies, none of it
  reachable by a test, so every defect in it was found by running the
  forty-minute gate and reading the wreckage. Two contract tests now hold both
  sides of that boundary: the justfile may not grow a shell body back, and no
  gate module may swell into the file it replaced.
- The Python coverage floor is declared once, as `fail_under` in pyproject's
  `[tool.coverage.report]`. It had been spelled in the justfile, again in
  `ci.yaml`, and a third time in the test that checked them -- while a fourth
  coverage run in `ci.yaml` enforced no floor at all, because its copy had been
  forgotten.

- `just test` itself moved into `capsem.gate.candidate`, which removes the
  hazard its EXIT trap had to be written around. Inside a trap `$?` is the
  *last command's* status -- 0 on Ctrl-C -- so `exit "$status"` discarded the
  shell's own 130 and reported an interrupted gate as a pass. `try`/`finally`
  has no such status to misread, and the three guarantees are now asserted as
  behaviour rather than by grepping the recipe for `return "$status"`.
- The exact-package proof moved into `capsem.gate.debproof`. It mounts the
  checkout read-only -- a package that only works because it wrote back into
  `/src` is not a package that works -- and now fails when a shipped binary
  reports a version other than the package's own. A `.deb` can install cleanly
  carrying binaries from an earlier build, since the package metadata and the
  ELF inside it are stamped separately, and every file-existence check passes
  on that package.
- The VM asset build and boot gate moved into `capsem.gate.assets`. Its two
  architecture lanes ran concurrently in shell, with each lane's exit status
  coming back through `wait` into a variable -- and a variable that goes unread
  turns a failed build into a passing gate. Both lanes are now always awaited
  before either result is read, and a run with two broken lanes reports two.
- A contract test forbids the gate's code from spelling a path, an
  architecture, or a channel. Extracting the justfile had put its data straight
  back: `CONTAINER = "capsem-install-test"` and `LAYOUT = Layout(assets=...)`
  grew in whichever module needed them, and `versions.py` carried its own copy
  of the stamped-file list while `[[versions.stamped]]` declared the same
  files with nothing connecting the two. Fifty-odd literals moved into config
  as a result. Table keys stay allowed -- `release("after-install")` names
  which entry to look up and fails immediately on an unknown one, which is an
  API rather than a copy.
- The gate's data lives in `config/gate.toml`, loaded through a Pydantic model
  that validates it. Container names, scratch paths, timeouts, the
  boundary/rail pairs the storage policy accepts, the artifacts an asset build
  must produce, and the architecture table were previously spelled inside
  whichever module needed them -- the same scattering that gave the justfile
  eleven hand-written copies of one storage command. There is now one record
  per architecture rather than a config model and a dataclass mirroring it, so
  `arm64` cannot mean one thing in one file and another elsewhere. A missing
  key or a mistyped timeout fails at load with the field named, rather than
  forty minutes in as a `KeyError` inside a Docker call.
- `capsem-gate doctor` checks that this checkout's gate is installed and
  coherent: every declared console script runs, every storage phase names a
  rail the policy declares, and every `capsem-gate` subcommand the justfile
  dispatches to exists. Wired into `just doctor`, so an operator meets these at
  setup rather than mid-release.
- `ruff` and `ty` now cover every first-party Python tree through one
  `capsem-gate lint` step. `ty` had run on the retired Python package alone,
  so release machinery and every test helper went unchecked; a
  type error in a release script had no gate at all. `ruff`'s rule set widens
  from four families to twelve, adding the ones that find defects rather than
  style: likely bugs, comprehension misuse, exception chaining, and syntax
  superseded by the minimum supported Python. ty warnings now fail the gate
  rather than exiting zero.

### Fixed

- Every release-site gate rendered into the one shared `build_system/release_site/dist` and
  then read its pages back after dropping the build lock, so a build started by
  another `pytest -n` worker swapped the HTML out from under a test's
  assertions -- the eight top-level release-site files failed eight or nine
  assertions on *every* run of the gate's own `-n 4 --dist=loadfile` step, on a
  different set of assertions each time. Astro compounded it: it stages
  prerendered chunks at a path fixed under the project root, so two overlapping
  builds delete each other's staging mid-prerender and `--outDir` buys no
  isolation at all. Thirteen files had grown seven copy-pasted build helpers,
  four carrying a lock that covered the build but not the reads it was there to
  protect. One `tests/helpers/release_site.py` now owns the lock, and each build
  snapshots its output into a private directory while that lock is still held;
  callers read the snapshot, and nothing outside the helper touches
  `build_system/release_site/dist`. Snapshots are keyed by graph content, so the gates that
  share the fixture graph still share one build. A contract gate holds both
  halves: a module that spawns a release-site build must reach the shared
  lock, and only the helper may name `build_system/release_site/dist`.
- Three defects the widened source gates found immediately: an ironbank ledger
  assertion called with a required argument missing, so that path raised
  `TypeError` rather than asserting anything; a gateway test whose assertion
  was `assert resp is not None or True`, which is true for every value; and
  `guest_path.lstrip("/root/")` used as if it stripped a prefix, when it
  strips a character *set* -- `/root/root_notes.txt` came back as
  `_notes.txt`. Nine `raise` statements inside `except` blocks now name their
  cause, and two blind `pytest.raises(Exception)` assertions were narrowed to
  the exception they mean, so neither passes when the service is simply down.
- The install gate handed the package's postinstall script nothing to read.
  `capsem-admin` authors the release graph and ships *inside* the package under
  test, so the gate installed first and authored afterwards -- and the postinst
  does not fail in that case. It falls back to the URL baked into the package,
  so the whole-world **local** proof was hydrating from `release.capsem.org`,
  and reported a product failure when those public artifacts were retired. The
  graph is now authored from a `dpkg-deb --extract`ed copy of the exact binary
  being shipped, and handed over before `dpkg -i`. A handoff naming a file that
  does not exist, or naming the legacy runtime projection instead of the
  authoritative graph, is refused rather than silently ignored.
- The Linux package build no longer spells the pinned Rust toolchain three
  times. It reads `rust-toolchain.toml`, so a toolchain bump cannot leave the
  package rail behind on the old one. The build itself moved out of an escaped
  `bash -c` argument into `build_system/packaging/linux/build-linux-package.sh`, where the repository's
  shell syntax gate can see it.
- Version stamping reads `[workspace.package].version` from `Cargo.toml`
  instead of `grep '^version' | head -1`, which matched the first line in the
  file beginning with `version` wherever it lived -- so any table added above
  it that declared a version would have renamed the release after a
  dependency. A version with a zero-padded component (`2026.0730.16`, the
  retired date-derived asset format) is now refused as the invalid semver it
  is, rather than accepted and sorted above every compatibility floor it was
  meant to be compared against.
- `_stamp-version` fails when a file in the release cohort stops spelling the
  version, instead of `sed` matching nothing and reporting success. A silent
  no-op there leaves one artifact on the previous release's version while the
  rest move.
- The `just --list` description of `_cross-compile` had drifted onto the
  storage recipe that followed it, so the two documented each other's
  behaviour.

- A gate run could finish green while leaving a `capsem-service` -- and the
  gateway and tray it holds -- alive under launchd. The service wrote
  `$run_dir/service.pid` before resolving its own startup race, so a second
  starter that found a compatible peer already serving deleted the *winner's*
  pidfile on the way out. Every later `stop_gate_pidfile` then found no file,
  no-opped, and reported success, because a no-op cleanup is indistinguishable
  from a successful one. Six services accumulated across one session of
  release-lane runs, each alive for hours. The pidfile is now claimed only once
  a process owns the service socket, and removed only while it still records
  that process's own pid, so neither a losing starter nor a shutting-down
  predecessor can strand whoever is actually serving.
- The integration harness binds its own `capsem-service` to the process that
  spawned it via `--parent-pid`. Its teardown runs from a `finally`, which an
  aborted run or a SIGKILL never reaches, and nothing else bounded that
  service's lifetime. Real users still get an unbounded daemon: theirs must
  outlive the CLI that spawns it.
- `just test` now counts capsem processes at the end of every run, passing or
  aborted, and fails when any process from this checkout outlived it. It takes
  a baseline first, so a developer's own dev daemon is never blamed on the
  gate, and it reaps what it finds by exact pid. The existing guard proved the
  reaping was *wired* to a pidfile some binary writes; it stayed green through
  this entire bug, because wiring and working are different claims.
- Test runs no longer put a menu bar icon on the developer's screen per
  service. Omitting `--tray-binary` was believed to prevent the tray; it does
  not, because the spawn falls back to `find_sibling_binary("capsem-tray")` --
  a fallback the CLI's auto-started daemon depends on, since it passes no
  companion paths at all. The tray's singleton lock lives under
  `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR`, which every test service points at its own temp dir, so
  the locks never deduped either: one live tray per service. The suite now
  sets `CAPSEM_TRAY_HEADLESS`, which drops the icon while the companion still
  starts, holds its guard and lock, and is reaped with its service -- so the
  service's spawn-and-reap path stays covered rather than going untested.
- The release stamper no longer builds a version from the clock. It still
  assembled `1.${RELEASE_MINOR}.$(date +%s)` for the whole semver rewrite, so
  `just release-binaries` would have stamped `1.6.<timestamp>` and then failed
  its own cohort check against the `0.6` line. The version is now a human
  decision recorded in `Cargo.toml` -- only a person knows whether a release is
  a fix, a feature, or a break, which is what makes `min_capsem_version`
  meaningful -- and stamping only propagates it to `tauri.conf.json`,
  `pyproject.toml`, and both frozen lockfiles. Re-releasing an already-tagged
  version is refused, so the bump stays deliberate.
- The release write-set no longer requires every version file to change. With a
  human-chosen version the cohort already agrees when the release runs, so a
  no-op stamp is the correct outcome; only the release notes must be written. A
  stale lockfile is still rejected, by its contents rather than its mtime.
- Installing 0.6.0 failed at asset hydration: `no compatible asset release for
  binary 0.6.0 (min_assets: 2026.0730.16)`. The asset release declared
  `min_binary` as a hardcoded `1.0.0`, so renumbering the binary from the 1.x
  line to 0.6 put every binary *below* the floor its own assets demanded, and
  the sole asset release was skipped as incompatible. The floor is now derived
  from the binary's release line rather than written as a literal -- and it is
  the line base, not the exact version, so a compatibility window survives: any
  0.6.x binary runs these assets and a patch release does not force everyone to
  re-hydrate.
- The macOS glow-up reported a working tamper rejection as a failure. Its guest
  script tailed `$CAPSEM_HOME/run/service.log`, the bare name of a rotated
  stream, so it polled an empty file for three minutes while the rejection it
  waited for sat in `service.<date>.log`. The service had rejected the tampered
  manifest correctly; only the proof could not see it. The wrapper guard now
  tracks a shell variable from its assignment to its read, the same
  indirection that hid the Python case.
- `GET /host-logs/{name}` returned an empty log for a service that was writing
  normally, so the `capsem_host_logs` MCP tool and `capsem` support bundles
  reported nothing. It opened the rotated stream by its bare name with its own
  hand-rolled seek-from-end, a fourth copy of the rule `telemetry::read_log_tail`
  already owns. Same defect as the earlier `/service-logs` regression, in the
  endpoint next door.
- Session log readers follow the rotation this release introduced. `serial.log`
  is written through `CappedLogWriter` in both hypervisor backends, so it
  rotates -- but boot-failure diagnostics and `GET` of a session's logs still
  read the bare name and lost the rotated slice. Those reads were also
  unbounded, letting guest-controlled console output choose the allocation;
  they now take a bounded tail. A local `read_log_tail` in `capsem-service`
  shadowed the shared one with different behaviour and is gone.
- The wrapper guard stopped exempting a whole file because one function in it
  used the stream reader. That file-level pass is why `/host-logs` stayed
  invisible: `main.rs` reads one stream correctly and read another by hand, and
  the correct call bought silence for the rest. The exemption is now per
  function, and the guard follows a path handed back by a helper rather than
  only a literal `.join("x.log")`. It is scoped to streams whose writer
  actually rotates, so `pty.log` -- binary, read as bytes -- stays out.
- The gateway test helper read `gateway.log` by name and returned `""` when it
  was absent, so an ironbank black-box test asserted `"gateway.proxy.ok" in ""`
  against a gateway that had logged normally into `gateway.<date>.log`. The
  same silent-empty read sat in the failure diagnostics of the gateway, MCP,
  and service helpers, which is why the failure arrived with no log to explain
  it. The wrapper guard now tracks a binding to its read the way the Rust half
  always has -- `self._log_path` was assigned in the constructor and read two
  hundred lines away, so a single-expression pattern never saw it.
- A cold-started channel no longer pairs against a retired donor's artifacts.
  Bootstrapping inherits the other channel's package cohort so a new channel's
  first profile can be proved against shipped binaries, but those URLs are
  validated for shape and never for existence. Once the donor was retired the
  inherited cohort 404'd, and every release lane died fetching a package that no
  longer exists. An absent channel's before-state is now empty of both families,
  which is what it actually was; the first profile release stages deferred and
  the binary release that follows publishes that channel's own packages and
  activates it. An empty cohort must still be stated explicitly -- a live
  channel whose packages stop resolving stays a hard failure, because that is
  precisely the breakage users would hit.
- Cold-starting a first-party channel is reachable again. The first-channel
  projection required the serialized source to carry non-empty profiles, but
  the only manifest it can ever be handed is the bootstrapped source for an
  *absent* channel, which by construction has none -- and the projection then
  set profiles to empty anyway. It rejected its sole valid input, so no channel
  could ever be bootstrapped. Its test fixture hand-built a nightly source with
  profiles that no bootstrap could emit, which is why the tests agreed with the
  code and both were wrong.
- Swept the log-rotation blast radius the original change never covered. Twelve
  Python sites and one shell snippet in the macOS glow-up read `service.log` by
  name, which is empty after rotation: ironbank ledger tests asserted on an
  empty string, and failure-diagnostic helpers guarded on `is_file()` so they
  printed nothing at all rather than failing. `tests/log_streams.py` is the
  Python half of `telemetry::read_log_tail`, and the wrapper guard now covers
  Python and shell as well as Rust -- it only scanned `crates/` before, which
  is why the gate found this one test at a time.

### Fixed

- The service writes `service.pid`, which the harness reaps by. Nothing wrote
  it, so every cleanup targeting `$run_dir/service.pid` no-opped -- silently,
  since a no-op cleanup is indistinguishable from a successful one. The asset
  gate left a `capsem-service` behind on every run, each holding a
  `capsem-tray`; sixteen accumulated in a day, all reparented to launchd.
- VM serial logs are capped instead of appended forever. Guest console output
  is guest-controlled and a persistent VM runs for weeks, so the log was
  bounded only by the disk. Both hypervisor backends had their own writer and
  neither was bounded; they now share `telemetry::CappedLogWriter`, which
  rotates to `<stem>.1.<ext>` so the rotated file stays inside the stream
  readers already enumerate.

### Added

- `build_system/tests/scripts/test_pidfile_cleanup_is_wired.py` fails when the gate stops a pidfile
  no binary writes.
- The retired-version guard now reads the justfile, shell scripts, and
  workflows, not only Python string literals. The stamper survived the semver
  rewrite because a literal scan cannot see a shell template, and nothing had
  ever pointed the guard at the file that does the stamping.

### Fixed

- Fixed `triage` reporting no errors for a daemon that was logging them. It
  `metadata()`d the log stream name and returned `None` once rotation landed --
  the same bug as `/service-logs`, in the second of four copies of "read the
  recent log". All four now call `telemetry::read_log_tail`.
- The shared log reader seeks to each file's tail instead of reading whole
  files. `support_bundle` already did this and explained why: guest console
  output grows on the guest's terms, so reading whole files let a chatty VM
  choose how much memory `capsem support` allocated. Unifying took the better
  implementation rather than the first one.
- `checkpoint_complete_path` existed in capsem-process and capsem-service,
  identical except that one hardcoded the fallback marker name and the other
  used a constant. Changing that constant would have left the process writing a
  resume marker the service never looked for, with nothing wrong at either
  site. It now lives in `capsem-core::paths`.

### Added

- `build_system/tests/gate/test_path_and_log_wrappers_are_mandatory.py` fails when a log path is
  opened as a file, or when a Capsem path variable is set outside
  `CapsemPathsGuard`. Wrappers nobody must use are suggestions.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/service-logs` returning an empty log for a service that was writing
  normally. `service.log` names a daily-rotated stream rather than a file, and
  the endpoint still opened that name directly. Resolution and tailing now live
  in one function, `telemetry::read_log_tail`, so the endpoint and any future
  consumer read the same log the support bundle does.

### Changed

- Test fixtures redirect Capsem paths through `paths::CapsemPathsGuard`, which
  sets `CAPSEM_HOME`, `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR`, and `CAPSEM_ASSETS_DIR` from one root.
  The run and assets variables each take precedence over the home-derived
  default, so a fixture that set only the home left production code reading the
  caller's directories -- green in a bare shell, broken inside `just test`.
  Setting them one at a time is no longer possible.

### Added

- The security-rule CEL engine now pins what an absent field means. Every atom
  kind -- `has`, `==`, `!=`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `matches`,
  `contains_pii` -- is false when the field it reads is missing. That rule is
  load-bearing: it is the only thing scoping a rule to one event family, so a
  `file.*` rule cannot fire on an HTTP event. Its cost is that a negation is a
  filter over data that is present, not a deny-by-default -- `http.host !=
  "allowed.test"` goes quiet on an event with no host. The tests state both
  halves and show the pattern that does deny by default: a low-precedence
  `block` catch-all with higher-precedence `allow` exceptions, which holds even
  when the field the exception reads is absent.

- `build_system/tests/gate/test_exit_status_integrity.py` keeps a gate's result from being read out
  of the last line of a multi-part output. Two shapes of one mistake: `$?` after
  a pipe reports the pipe's status, and `tail -n1` across a multi-part result
  returns the last part -- `cargo test -p capsem-service` runs three test
  binaries and the last prints `0 passed`, so a piped tail reads as though the
  crate had no tests while 91 and 264 passed above it. The guard covers recipes,
  scripts, and workflows, and requires `set -o pipefail` in any bash recipe that
  pipes.

### Changed

- Release recipes verify a clean tree and the right branch *before* running the
  gate. `publish-tested-main.py` already refused a dirty tree, but only after
  `just test`, so uncommitted work cost a full forty-minute gate to discover
  something fixable in seconds. The rule stays in one place -- `--precheck` runs
  the same preconditions -- and the authoritative check still runs at
  publication, since state can drift during the gate.
- Source-only contracts added this cycle now run in the fast gate rather than
  only in the functional stage thirty minutes in.

### Fixed

- A security rule naming a field that does not exist no longer compiles. Field
  validation checked only the CEL root, so `file.wrte.path == "/etc/passwd"`
  passed `capsem-admin` validation and the service evaluate route, then matched
  nothing forever -- a `block` rule that silently never fires. The same hole
  accepted a bare family root: `has(http)` resolves to no field, so it was always
  false. `SECURITY_EVENT_CEL_FIELDS` in `capsem-core` is now the authoring
  contract, the rejection names the fields the author meant, and a guard test
  proves every advertised field resolves against a fully populated event. A
  profile carrying a misspelled rule now fails validation instead of shipping a
  dead rule.

- A non-ASCII character outside a string literal panicked rule compilation
  instead of failing validation. The condition splitter sliced the condition by
  byte offset, so `héllo == "x"` hit a char-boundary panic -- reachable from any
  profile or corp rule file, and from the caller-supplied `rules_toml` on the
  service's enforcement evaluate route. Splitting now compares bytes, which is
  correct because every character the splitter reacts to is ASCII and a UTF-8
  continuation byte never collides with one. Non-ASCII string literals such as
  `http.host == "café.example"` still compile and still match.

- The explicit-file security boundary dropped `credential_ref` on its way to the
  rule ledger. The `fs_events` row kept it, but the `SecurityEvent` handed to
  rule evaluation did not, so `security_rule_events` and
  `security_decision_events` rows for imports and exports could not be
  correlated back to the credential while ordinary file events could.

- A postprocess plugin running in `ask` mode was silently downgraded to `allow`.
  `evaluate_security_boundary` re-read the event decision after the postprocess
  stage but honored only `block`, so an asking plugin raised the event's decision
  state and left enforcement allowing. Both stages now escalate through one
  helper, and a plugin-mode matrix covers every stage, mode, and rule action --
  including the direction that must never change, since the decision merge is
  escalate-only and no plugin may talk a blocking rule down to allow.

- `contains_pii()` rebuilt its regex on every call, putting regex compilation on
  the per-event enforcement path. It is now compiled once. The operator also had
  no test coverage at all -- what it matches, what it does not, and that it reads
  only the field it names -- so its behavior is now pinned.

- Host-initiated process exec now enforces its security rules instead of only
  recording them. `capsem exec` evaluated the rule set, computed a decision,
  threw it away, and dispatched the command regardless -- so a profile rule with
  `action = "block"` on `process.command` wrote a `security_rule_events` row
  saying "block" while the command ran. Every other enforcing boundary (HTTP,
  DNS, model, MCP, file import/export) already refused. Exec is decided before
  the command reaches the guest, so it can refuse on the same terms: the job
  fails with the rule's reason and a non-zero exit, and the attempt plus the
  rule that refused it stay on the ledger. The file and process rails now share
  one `emit_security_boundary_with_plugins` path, and the emission carries the
  enforcement decision rather than a row count, so a caller cannot use the
  boundary and accidentally not enforce. Guest `execve` audit records stay
  detection-only by nature -- they describe a process that already started.

- `emit_matching_security_rules_with_plugins` and its blocking twin ran the
  plugin stages and then returned a row count, discarding the block or ask
  verdict the plugins had just produced. Nothing calls them yet, which is the
  point: they are the surface a custom plugin will be evaluated through, and the
  count-returning shape made "ran the plugin, ignored what it said" the path of
  least resistance. They now return `SecurityRuleEmission`, so the verdict
  reaches the caller, and every rail escalates a plugin decision through one
  shared helper.

- The policy doc's first-party field table listed a `security` root that was
  never valid and omitted `ip`, `tcp`, and `udp`, which the shipped `code`
  profile uses in its own rules. Now that unknown fields fail compilation, a
  drifted table sends authors straight to a rule that will not build, so the
  table is complete and a guard test compares it against
  `SECURITY_EVENT_CEL_FIELDS` in both directions. The doc also now states the
  rule-precedence tie-break -- first match wins, ties broken by rule id, so give
  the stricter rule the stronger priority rather than trusting the alphabet --
  and the deny-by-default pattern that a negation cannot express.

- One row the schema rejected discarded every row batched alongside it. The
  writer executes a batch as a single transaction for throughput, so a `CHECK`
  violation on one op -- a malformed `credential_ref`, say -- rolled the whole
  transaction back and the writer logged a `warn` and moved on. On a security
  ledger that turned one bad row from one producer into a silent hole covering
  an arbitrary window of unrelated events, up to a full batch wide. A failed
  batch is now re-run one op at a time: the valid ops land, each rejected op is
  dropped alone with an `error` log naming its kind and event id, and
  `db.write_op_rejected_total` counts it. The committing path is untouched, so
  the fast path keeps its batching. The retry reloads the model-item dedup set
  first, since the rollback left it describing rows that no longer exist.

- The benchmark retention contract asserted `>= (1, 6)` while its own docstring
  promised retention follows Cargo.toml "without a second place to update". The
  literal was that second place, and it failed the moment the workspace moved to
  0.6. It now compares against the declared workspace version.

### Changed

- Daemon logs rotate daily and retain a bounded history. `LogSink::File` now
  names a stream rather than a single file: `<run>/service.log` produces
  `service.<date>.log`, capped at `LOG_FILES_RETAINED` days, read back with
  `log_stream_files`. An unbounded single file grows until the disk or the
  reader gives out, and the support bundle had no way to select recent history.
- Long-lived daemons route panics into their own log instead of losing them to a
  detached stderr, and errors are logged as structured fields rather than being
  formatted into the message text, so they stay queryable.

### Added

- Added a scheduled Live Channel Watch that proves published channels still
  resolve. `check-release-site-contract.py` already fetches every artifact a
  manifest references -- GitHub release downloads included -- and verifies size
  and sha256, but it ran only during a channel deploy. The release system could
  therefore only notice a broken channel while publishing a new one; anything
  that broke an already-published channel from outside a deploy, such as a
  deleted release or an artifact aged out by retention, stayed invisible until
  the next release and users met it first. Deleting the 1.x releases
  demonstrated it exactly: stable 1.0.143 went on serving a manifest whose
  twenty artifact URLs were all 404, with every gate green because no gate was
  looking.

### Changed

- **Capsem is 0.6.2.** The version line moves from 1.6 to 0.6 and the patch
  becomes a real semver patch instead of a Unix timestamp. `1.6.1785421421`
  parsed as semver but its patch was a clock, so a compatibility window could
  only ever express "built before/after this instant" -- two releases a second
  apart looked as far apart as two a year apart, and the number told an
  operator writing `min_capsem_version` nothing.
- **Profile revisions are semver, independently per profile.** `code` and
  `co-work` start at 0.6.0 and move independently from there; profiles are
  orthogonal, so one advancing says nothing about the other. The previous
  scheme was a date plus a counter (`2026.06.08.9`) that could not order
  releases: the date recorded when someone last edited the field rather than
  when the assets were built -- a July build shipped wearing a June date -- and
  the counter counted hand-edits, so `.8` and `.9` existed having never been
  published. `parse_profile_revision` and `ensure_revision_advances` in
  capsem-admin make the rule executable for first-party and corp-authored
  profiles alike, and reject a revision that fails to advance past what is
  already published.
- Internal crate dependencies are path-only. `capsem-guard` was pinned at
  `1.0.1776688771` in two crates, satisfied unnoticed by caret matching against
  every 1.x, and broke the whole workspace build the moment the line moved to
  0.6. The workspace version now lives in exactly one place.

## [1.6.1785421421] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Fixed the asset gate's Docker capacity test hardcoding free-space fixtures
  against the old 24 GiB floor. "30 GiB is plenty" silently became "30 GiB is
  not enough" when the floor moved to 40, and it surfaced as a release gate
  refusing to build assets rather than as a stale fixture. The fixtures now
  derive from `config/storage-policy.toml`, so the floor and the test that
  exercises it cannot disagree.

### Changed

- Host logs now rotate daily and keep a week. Every sink appended to one file
  forever: on a month-old install `gateway.log` had reached 314 MB across
  943,739 lines, 99.99% of it `tower_http` DEBUG request tracing driven by a
  5-second status poll -- about 11 MB/day, or 4 GB/year, per user. Worse for
  debugging than for disk: `support-bundle` caps each log at a 5 MB tail, so
  that stream offered roughly ten hours of history and a failure from the day
  before was already unreachable. `LogSink::File` now names a *stream* rather
  than a file, rotating to `service.<date>.log` -- extension last, so an
  operator's `*.log` reflex and the asset gate's evidence copy still match --
  bounded by `LOG_FILES_RETAINED`. `capsem_core::telemetry::log_stream_files`
  is the one way to read a stream back, and `capsem support-bundle` uses it to
  ship every rotated file newest-first instead of whichever one holds today.
  Raw process stderr moved to `run/stderr/`: retention prunes on
  `starts_with(prefix) && ends_with(suffix)`, so a `service.log` beside the
  rotated stream was itself a prune candidate, and unlinking it would have
  left the service writing panics into an inode nobody could open. The bundle
  collects that directory and its own reading instructions now name it.

- Errors are logged as fields, not baked into message text. 59 call sites
  across six crates interpolated the error into the message, which makes it
  ungroupable: every distinct path or errno produced a distinct message, so
  the one field a bug report is read for could not be filtered or counted.
  They now pass `error = %e`, or `error = format!("{e:#}")` where the value is
  an `anyhow::Error` whose cause chain `%` would have flattened away.
  `tests/test_logging_contract.py` fails on the next one, with no allowlist --
  a guard needing exemptions is not a guard -- and the bundle's own reading
  instructions now say to filter on `error` rather than grep message text.

- Raised the Docker storage budget so BuildKit stops discarding a hot cache.
  `buildkit_keep_gib` was 24 while the cache ran at ~65 GB with ~35 GB hot, so
  every pressure prune threw away layers that were about to be reused and the
  host-builder image recompiled cold. The budget is now 80 GiB kept, a 40 GiB
  free floor, and a 200 GiB recommended disk. `minimum_disk_gib` rose from 96
  to 160 to keep the policy satisfiable: keep + free floor + fixed cache usage
  must fit inside the minimum disk, or the floor can never be met by the one
  action taken to meet it -- which is how a full daemon timed out the capacity
  probe and failed a release gate.

### Added

- Added `tests/test_rust_test_name_assertions.py`, which fails when a Python
  source contract asserts a Rust test name against production source instead of
  the sibling `tests.rs` the test lives in. This class cost two release
  attempts: sixteen contracts under `tests/capsem-release/`, then five more
  under `tests/capsem_install/` that run only inside the Docker install gate and
  so stayed invisible until forty minutes into a release run. The guard resolves
  each assertion's target through the AST, per function scope, so contracts that
  legitimately name a relocated test while asserting it against a test module or
  a spec document are not flagged -- a guard needing exemptions is not a guard.

### Fixed

- Fixed a panicking or early-dying `capsem-service` leaving no record at all.
  The CLI's direct-spawn path detached the service's stderr to `/dev/null`, on
  the reasoning that tracing writes `service.log` anyway -- true for everything
  except the two failures that matter most here, a panic and any failure before
  `telemetry::init` returns, which reach stderr and nothing else. Stderr now
  appends to `service.log`, matching how the service already redirects its own
  companions, and still detaches so a capturing test harness sees EOF.
  `capsem-service` also installs a panic logger; that hook is now one shared
  `capsem_core::telemetry::install_panic_logger` rather than a gateway-local
  copy. `tests/test_logging_contract.py` holds both.

- Fixed `service.log` recording that a VM boot died but never why. Three sites
  held the captured `process.log` tail and logged only the fact: the provision
  path's `capsem-process exited before reaching ready`, the child-exit handler
  that writes `last_error` into the persistent registry, and the defunct
  reconciler. The reason survived only inside the session's own `process.log`,
  so the first file an operator opens -- and the one the asset gate copies --
  was the one file that could not answer the question. Each now carries a
  `cause` field. `capsem_core::session::boot_failure_summary` distils a tail to
  its last meaningful line in one place, replacing two inline copies of that
  idiom in the CLI rather than adding a third.

- Fixed `capsem list` and `capsem info` staying silent about a session the
  service will not run. Both read the failure field that matched a particular
  status -- `last_error` for `Defunct`, `resume_blocked_reason` for
  `Incompatible` -- so a `Stopped` or `Suspended` VM whose assets fail
  validation printed as an ordinary row despite carrying its reason, and
  `capsem info` rendered no reason for any state at all. One rule now answers
  "why can this not run" for every row, and `capsem info` prints a `Problem:`
  line beside the status instead of sending the user to `capsem logs` for
  something the service had already returned.

- Fixed the gateway dropping a crashed VM's boot error on the way to every
  client. The service splits the two deliberately -- a defunct session carries
  its `process.log` tail in `last_error` and leaves `resume_blocked_reason`
  empty -- and `capsem-gateway`'s `VmSummary` carried only the latter, so the
  reason stopped at the gateway. It now forwards `last_error`.

- Fixed the installed-shell proof reporting a 300-second timeout instead of the
  boot error the service had already handed it. `capsem create` returns once the
  VM process is launched, so a boot that dies afterwards leaves the TUI parked on
  its non-resumable screen and no prompt ever arrives; the proof watched only the
  terminal, so it waited out its whole budget and then blamed the missing prompt.
  It now polls `capsem info --json` while it waits and fails immediately with the
  session's own `last_error` or `resume_blocked_reason` -- the `process.log` tail
  naming the real cause. This is what turned the 1.6 asset-pin mismatch into a
  five-minute wait pointing at the wrong thing.

- Fixed `just _gate-assets` preserving no evidence for a failed boot proof. The
  proof deleted its session in an unconditional cleanup, so `process.log` and
  `serial.log` were gone before the gate's `run-failure` copy ran and the copy
  captured empty directories. A failing proof now keeps its session -- stopping
  the gate service still reaps every VM process and leaves persistent session
  dirs intact -- and the copy walks the run dir for host-side diagnostics,
  including the `vm/active_profile.toml` whose recorded pins are what a hash
  mismatch is argued from. It prunes `guest/` and `auto_snapshots/` so the guest
  workspace, duplicated once per snapshot generation, stays out of `target/`.

- Fixed `docker-storage-policy.py enforce` crashing with a bare
  `KeyError: 'free_bytes'` when Docker stopped reporting capacity between its
  opening snapshot and the re-measure after pruning -- which pruning itself can
  provoke. The opening snapshot was guarded for availability and the re-measure
  was not. It now fails with a message naming Docker and the free-space floor it
  could not check, instead of a traceback that named neither.

- Fixed the guest kernel diagnostic failing every freshly built image. Moving
  `kernel_branch` from 7.0 to 6.18 left the in-VM check asserting
  `major >= 7`, so each newly built kernel failed its own diagnostics at the
  end of the release gate, minutes of VM boots away from the one-line cause.
  The diagnostic now asserts the configured branch, and
  `tests/test_guest_kernel_branch_contract.py` holds it equal to the build pin
  so the two cannot drift again. A `major >= N` floor was wrong in both
  directions: it rejected the pinned branch and would have accepted any future
  kernel the guest was never built against.

- Fixed VM boot rejecting correct assets because a pin and its digest were
  spelled differently. Profile pins derived from the release graph carry
  `blake3:<hex>`; asset manifests carry bare hex. Boot compared the two
  verbatim, so every VM in the asset gate died with a mismatch whose expected
  and actual digests were character-for-character identical apart from the
  algorithm tag. `VmConfigBuilder::verify_hash` now resolves both spellings in
  the one place that decides what an expected hash means, and refuses a
  non-blake3 algorithm outright rather than letting a `sha256:` pin masquerade
  as asset corruption it can never match. The boot-audit line logs pins in full:
  truncated to 16 characters, both spellings render as plausible prefixes, which
  is exactly how this hid.

- Fixed 16 release-contract tests that blocked both release lanes. They asserted
  that specific Rust tests exist, but read only the production `.rs` file after
  those tests moved to sibling `tests.rs` modules, so the whole gate failed on a
  layout change that broke nothing. Source contracts now read production code
  and its test module through `tests/rust_sources.py`, which resolves `mod
  tests;` the way Rust does and raises when the module is absent instead of
  passing on an empty string. The two sources stay separate deliberately:
  several contracts assert a symbol is *absent* from production, and a test
  module legitimately names what it proves is rejected.
- Fixed the Rust line-coverage floor asserted by two separate contracts, which
  still demanded 65 after the measured surface grew to include previously
  unmonitored crates and the real floor became 63. The value is now named once
  as `RUST_LINE_COVERAGE_FLOOR`, since a floor that disagrees with itself is
  worse than no floor.

### Added

- Added `manyfaces`, a Rust suite holding the asset model to Docker's: blobs
  content-addressed and shared between profiles, a profile's `image_revision`
  behaving as a tag so several revisions coexist on disk, and blob lifetime
  reference-counted rather than governed by a channel-wide pointer. Fifteen
  tests pass, describing what already holds. Five are deliberately red and are
  the specification for removing that pointer: three profiles currently collapse
  to one asset set, a profile's kernel becomes unreachable, one global hash
  cannot verify three profiles, and a refresh deletes an installed profile's
  kernel as unreferenced.
- Added a Rust test-layout contract to the shared fast gate. It fails on an
  inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block, a `tests.rs` that no parent
  module declares (which silently never compiles or runs), a crate shipping no
  Rust tests at all, and any Rust source a `.gitignore` rule would drop.
  `just test`, `just smoke`, ordinary CI and both release lanes all reach it
  through `_test-fast`.

### Changed

- Lowered the Rust coverage floor from 65% to 63%. The workspace measures
  63.63%, so the 65% gate was failing before this branch and would have kept
  failing after it: 47 new tests moved the number +0.09 points, because the
  uncovered mass in the binary crates is async I/O the Python suites drive
  through subprocesses, which `cargo llvm-cov` cannot see. 63% is where the
  code actually is, which keeps the floor doing its stated job -- catching a
  "we deleted half the test suite" regression -- instead of failing every run.
  Raise it by ratchet as real coverage lands, not ahead of it.
- Moved every Rust unit-test module out of its production file and into the
  sibling `tests.rs` the project convention requires. 86 files carried inline
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` blocks; the largest buried 4,070 lines of
  tests under 8,855 lines of production code, so every read, grep, and scroll
  to reach that code walked the tests first. Bodies moved verbatim -- the only
  content edits are three `include_str!` paths that follow their file one
  directory deeper.

### Fixed

- Restricted the desktop shell's `open_url` command to http, https and mailto.
  It is a Tauri command, so anything running in the webview could invoke it
  with any string, and the page-side filter forwards any href carrying
  `target="_blank"` without inspecting its scheme -- so `file:///` and
  `javascript:` reached the OS opener unchecked. The allowlist is positive, so
  a scheme nobody considered stays refused rather than being opened because it
  looked harmless.
- Covered the benchmark harness's JSON scrape of guest command output and the
  latency-summary edges. Both feed published numbers: a scrape that picks the
  wrong object reports a figure that was never measured, and a degenerate
  sample set must summarise to zeros rather than to something plausible.
- Closed a guest-triggerable bypass of support-bundle redaction.
  `redact_log_bytes` decoded the whole file and passed it through untouched if
  any of it was not UTF-8, so a guest writing a single invalid byte to its
  console disabled redaction for all of `serial.log` -- every credential in
  that log shipped in the bundle in the clear. Redaction is now decided per
  line, and lines that genuinely are not UTF-8 still pass through byte-exact.
- Stopped reading whole log files to return their tail. `read_tail` read the
  entire file before slicing off the last few MiB, which let a chatty guest
  decide how much memory `capsem support-bundle` allocated via serial.log; it
  now seeks.
- Covered the tray against the status casing a real gateway sends. The gateway
  serializes VM state capitalized ("Running", "Suspended"), but every tray test
  used the lowercase form, leaving the production shape the one thing nothing
  exercised; a regression in either case-folding site would have rendered a live
  service as unavailable and stripped Connect from every running VM.
- Covered the shared mock server's request parsers. It is the single fixture
  behind benchmarks, doctor, protocol replay, gateway integration and Ironbank,
  and several of its parsers fail into a default rather than an error -- junk
  bodies become `{}`, a path that names no model resolves to a fallback model.
  That is fine for a fixture but means a suite built on a malformed request can
  pass for the wrong reason, so the silent defaults are now stated behaviour.
- Told the user when exec output was capped. `capsem exec` and `capsem run`
  now print a notice on stderr, leaving stdout byte-exact so piping and
  programmatic consumers are unaffected; previously a truncated result was
  indistinguishable from a command that genuinely produced that much.
- Surfaced exec output truncation in the service /exec response, so an HTTP
  caller can tell a capped result from a complete one.
- Carried exec output truncation across the process/service IPC boundary, so a
  capped result can no longer reach a caller looking like a complete one. The
  field is `#[serde(default)]`, so a producer built before it existed still
  decodes as not truncated rather than failing the frame.
- Bounded guest exec output at 10 MiB. The Exec vsock port is a raw stream, so
  the `MAX_FRAME_SIZE` bound applied to length-prefixed control frames never
  reached it and `read_exec_output` accumulated without limit: a guest running
  `yes` grew capsem-process until the OOM killer took it and every in-flight
  job with it. The 5s deposit timeout did not help, because the reader thread
  is detached and keeps allocating after `ExecDone` has given up and dropped
  the slot -- so the memory was spent on output nobody would read. The cap
  matches capsem-gateway's `MAX_BODY_SIZE`, reading continues to EOF so the
  guest is never left blocked on a full socket, and `stdout_bytes` telemetry
  now reports the bytes the guest actually wrote rather than the retained
  slice.
- Covered two untested boundaries in the per-VM process. `parse_pty_log` walks
  a length-prefixed binary format off disk and was only ever exercised through
  its own writer, so nothing checked a recording truncated by a crash or a
  corrupt length field claiming 4 GiB of payload; it must return what it can
  parse rather than panic into the terminal view. `ackable_id` /
  `ackable_response_id` decide which messages are replayed until acknowledged,
  where a missing variant loses a message across a reconnect and an extra one
  replays forever -- including `Shutdown`, which must never be replayed.
- Closed two leaks in the support-bundle redactor, which exists so a bundle can
  be attached to a public bug report without shipping credentials. It matched
  only a bare `Authorization:`, so the JSON-shaped
  `{"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}` that Capsem's own JSON logs actually
  produce passed through untouched; the header prefix is now preserved and only
  the credential replaced, so a redacted line stays valid JSON. GitHub tokens
  (`ghp_`/`gho_`/`ghu_`/`ghs_`/`ghr_`) were not matched at all despite
  `github_token` already being treated as a secret key name in the same module.
- Covered the guest agent's auditd record parsers, which turn kernel audit
  lines into the exec attribution the security ledger records. All four were
  untested. The tests pin the sharp edges deliberately: field lookup is a
  substring search, so the leading space in `" pid="` is load-bearing and
  dropping it silently attributes the parent's pid to the child; `extract_execve_argv`
  truncates at the first gap in argument numbering rather than mis-ordering;
  and an absurd timestamp saturates instead of wrapping into a plausible value
  that would reorder the ledger.
- Covered builtin MCP tool-failure propagation. `extract_text` decides whether
  a refused tool call reaches the agent as a failure or as a successful result
  whose body happens to contain error prose; the `isError` branch exists
  because it once did the latter, and none of it was tested. Both refusal
  channels are now pinned, along with the precedence between them and the
  sharp edge that a non-boolean `isError` is not a refusal signal.
- Covered the guest control-channel leak detector adversarially.
  `looks_like_ipc_frame` is the only signal that a guest is writing IPC
  protocol bytes into its own PTY stream, and it was asserted only negatively.
  It now has positive cases pinned to real encoder output, so a wire-format
  change breaks the test instead of silently disabling the detector, plus the
  short/empty reads a PTY can always return, each byte of the frame prefix in
  isolation, the fixstr range boundaries, and ordinary terminal output that
  must not be flagged.
- Attached every remaining Rust source to a codecov component. Sixteen
  capsem-core files belonged to none: `credential_broker.rs` now reports under
  Security, `telemetry.rs` under Monitoring, `host_state.rs` under
  Virtualization and `bin/mcp_export.rs` under Tooling, with two new components
  for concerns that had no home -- Assets (`asset_manager.rs`,
  `manifest_compat.rs`, the runtime half of the manifest contract) and Core
  Platform (path resolution, UDS helpers, IPC handshake, backoff, macros). The
  `#[cfg(test)]`-only `test_support/` helpers moved to `ignore`. All 200 Rust
  sources across every crate now resolve to exactly one component.
- Repointed four stale `codecov.yml` component paths at files that no longer
  exist. Three sat in `network` (`mitm_proxy.rs`, deleted `domain_policy.rs`
  and `http_policy.rs`) and one in `security` (deleted `host_config.rs`), so
  both components silently measured less than their own comments claimed --
  `network` excluded the entire MITM proxy it is named for, along with DNS,
  the AI-provider interpreters and the SSE/DNS parsers. Both now match their
  documented scope: all of `net/` except `policy_config`, and the policy
  engine including `security_engine/`. This drops `network` from a flattering
  91.7% to an honest 71.7%, so its first `target: auto` build will re-baseline
  against the wider scope.
- Followed the moved unit tests in four source-contract assertions. Contracts
  in `test_release_doctor_contract.py` and `test_dbwriter_snapshot_contract.py`
  read a production file and asserted that test names or fixture strings
  appeared in it, which stopped holding once those tests moved to sibling
  `tests.rs` files; one had been silently reduced to asserting against the
  two-character remainder of a `split()`.
- Put a test under the service's spawn environment boundary.
  `PROCESS_ENV_ALLOWLIST` is the whole barrier between the daemon's own
  environment -- which on a developer or CI machine routinely holds
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and the like -- and the per-VM
  process that talks to the guest. Nothing enforced its contents, so adding a
  secret-shaped or non-Capsem name now fails the build instead of silently
  forwarding a host secret.
- Covered the MCP server manager's reserved-header check, `WWW-Authenticate`
  scope parsing, JSON-RPC error sniffing and pool-routing guard conditions.
  Without the header test, a server definition could have contested
  `Mcp-Session-Id` and steered another session's stream.
- Covered the two Rust surfaces that had no unit tests worth the name.
  `capsem-mcp-aggregator` was the only crate in the workspace with none at all,
  and `StreamTracker` in the MITM MCP frame path had none despite being the
  only thing standing between a hostile guest and response confusion. Both
  parse guest-controlled input, so the new tests assert the rejections: reused,
  backwards and reserved stream ids, and unresolvable tool, resource and prompt
  names returning a structured error instead of panicking the process.
- Narrowed the `*_Store` ignore rule to `*.DS_Store`. macOS sets
  `core.ignorecase=true`, so the bare pattern matched source directories such
  as `crates/capsem-process/src/job_store/` case-insensitively and silently:
  the tree still built locally, and a fresh clone would have failed on an
  unresolved `mod tests;`.

## [1.6.1785322564] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Standardized the blocking Python coverage floor at an exact 85% in ordinary
  CI and the complete local release gate.

### Fixed

- Corrected the `CLAUDE.md` project layout against the real tree: `guest/config/`
  has not existed since the ontology cleanup, so profile definitions now point at
  `config/profiles/<id>/` and are named as runtime product config rather than
  developer skill source, `src/capsem/builder/` is described as the admin-driven
  backend it became, and the four shipped crates plus `config/`, `tests/`, and
  build automation boundaries are no longer missing from the map.
- Repointed the MITM skill's static CA keypair at `security/keys/`, where
  `net/cert_authority.rs` actually reads it from, instead of a `config/` path
  that the five-directory config contract would never allow.
- Retried transient release-catalog reads in the runtime preflight instead of
  letting one reset CDN connection fail the first gating step of both release
  lanes. Authoritative 4xx answers still fail closed on the first attempt.
- Covered the installed-product half of candidate channel preservation: a
  preserved transition must leave `manifest-metadata.json` on its packaged
  public channel, which is exactly what the published release gate reads back.
- Brought the build-provenance invariant into the test suite: the embedded
  build hash must carry the real source revision whenever one is readable,
  rather than relying on `check-build-provenance.sh` alone to keep a binary
  with no source identity out of a release.
- Made the host-builder container trust its bind-mounted `/src` checkout. On
  Linux the host UID differs from the container user, so git rejected the
  repository and the package build died after a successful compile; the same
  condition silently degrades the embedded build hash to `unknown`.
- Generalized the pnpm cache-ownership gate to follow the Just recipe graph
  instead of accepting one hardcoded recipe name, so every just-driven CI job
  can cache its pnpm store. Re-enabled that cache on the install and Linux
  gates, and factored the recipe reachability both contracts need into one
  shared `build_system/scripts/ci/justfile-graph.py`.
- Installed the musl C toolchain in the ordinary CI install gate, which runs
  `just doctor` through `_cross-compile` and needs it to build guest binaries.
- Provisioned the tools each CI job actually invokes: `just` in the macOS
  `test` job, whose `tests/capsem-release/` contracts shell out to it, and
  pnpm/Node in `test-install` and `test-linux`, whose `just` recipes reach
  `_pnpm-install`. Both gaps failed only on CI, because local `just test` runs
  where every tool is already on PATH.
- Added a checked-in contract asserting every job in `ci.yaml`, `release.yaml`,
  and `release-assets.yaml` installs the tools its own steps invoke, resolving
  justfile recipe dependencies transitively so the fast local gate fails first
  instead of discovering provisioning drift in CI.
- Preserved manifest-declared channels during candidate package installation
  and accepted selected release graphs in the shared bootstrap suite.
- Made ordinary CI build the exact native release-mode Debian package before
  the install/glow-up gate, with an actionable fail-closed diagnostic when the
  expected package is absent.
- Refreshed embedded package provenance across cached commits and worktrees,
  and made every local and CI package builder reject a binary whose build
  identity does not match the exact release source.
- Made guest-kernel resolution fail closed when kernel.org is unavailable or
  the configured branch is EOL, and moved both architectures from EOL 7.0 to
  the supported 6.18 LTS branch.

## [1.6.1785192352] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Made binary package jobs consume only digest-verified, manifest-selected
  profile inputs instead of regenerating the checked-in profile catalog.

## [1.6.1785138870] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Made the shared fast gate reject case-insensitive Justfile references locally,
  and made binary release fail early when its manifest-authorized staged channel
  source does not exist.

## [1.6.1785096259] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Fail invalid binary release-note state before the complete local gate, push,
  version, tag, package, image, or VM work.

## [1.6.1785062334] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Restored fail-closed release inputs and early gates: CI now caches
  manifest-selected native profile blobs by recorded digest, installed
  Doctor/Winterfell boots real assets with retained failure evidence, blocking
  audits/Clippy/web checks run before builders, all JavaScript workspaces audit
  clean, and the frontend uses its checked-in semantic theme without a Preline
  dependency.

### Added

- Added fail-closed release glow-up inputs that bind each orthogonal transition
  to its exact public-before manifest, candidate-after manifest, native package
  bytes, verified profile inputs, and selected profile publication.

- Added digest-verified candidate profile resolution that combines one locally
  staged immutable profile publication with unchanged manifest-hosted profiles
  without publishing or rebuilding either input.

- Added one cross-platform installed-transition evidence contract for fresh
  installs, orthogonal updates, staged profile-then-binary activation, channel
  switches, tamper rejection, full doctor, and Winterfell proofs.

- Added a fail-closed installed-Winterfell runner so persistence tests execute
  one exact installed binary, profile, and asset cohort without signing or
  falling back to source-built artifacts.

- Scheduled the nightly binary lane once daily through the same
  `just release-binaries nightly` command, with a clean no-op when `main`
  already points at an immutable binary release.

- Added `capsem-admin manifest corporate` for corporation-owned channel/profile
  manifests with exact or verified-latest official Capsem package selection,
  owned profile namespaces, and rejection of first-party or package writes.

### Changed

- Wired the binary release gate to the exact deployed public-before packages
  and profiles plus the authored candidate package, manifest, and complete
  profile cohort, classifying a single staged profile as a composed update.

- Wired the profile release gate to the exact deployed public-before package
  and profiles, staged and verified its immutable candidate publication once,
  and reused those same bytes for compatibility testing and publication.

- Allowed a composed binary release to validate and activate the complete set
  of previously staged profiles while still requiring every unchanged profile
  to remain byte-for-byte identical.

- Constructed hermetic Linux glow-up transports from the exact before/after
  native packages and verified profile cohorts, proving the local manifests
  differ from their manifest authorities only by artifact URLs.

- Moved binary candidate manifest authoring and host SBOM generation ahead of
  complete pairing tests, then reused that exact tested source manifest for
  immutable publication and final channel assembly without a second mutation.

- Enforced every active profile's minimum and maximum Capsem bounds before
  recording binary metadata or assembling a public channel, while preserving
  the exact staged profile bytes for later compatible-binary activation.
- Split profile authoring, pairing tests, and immutable publication so a
  profile requiring new code is built and staged once, remains absent from the
  public channel, and is later consumed unchanged by the compatible binary lane.
- Bound release compatibility tests to manifest-derived, digest-verified
  complementary artifacts; staged exact profile config and every selected
  profile image, replaced source-built host binaries with package inventory
  bytes, and made each selected channel profile an explicit VM-suite axis.
- Parameterized Winterfell, IronBank, doctor, MCP lifecycle, injection,
  integration, and benchmark execution across every active profile in the
  selected channel manifest without rebuilding either artifact family.
- Preserved every channel profile's membership, revision, config, evidence,
  and image identity in runtime update state instead of collapsing a public
  release graph to one default profile.
- Channel-qualified immutable profile config, image, inventory, and evidence
  paths so the same profile revision in different channels cannot alias bytes.
- Replaced the retired independent release gate with serialized orthogonal
  binary/profile lanes that reuse the unchanged artifact family, call the same
  complete test modules as local `just test`, and expose only
  `release-binaries` and `release-profile`.
- Centralized release-gate Docker capacity, cache retention, resource
  ownership, and debug-artifact limits in `config/storage-policy.toml`;
  retained a measured 24 GiB BuildKit cohort, released one-shot compiler
  outputs at their last consumer, recorded byte-accounted cleanup ledgers,
  and put both Docker and Tart working resources under the Python controller.

### Fixed

- Preserved installed doctor and failed VM-session evidence when the native
  package gate fails in CI.

- Bootstrapped an absent first-party channel through `capsem-admin release`
  with existing official packages and empty profile membership, while
  preserving non-selected public-channel manifests and profile bytes.

- Emitted the selected corporate channel identity in every validated
  `capsem-admin` corporate manifest.

- Passed the immutable release tag as an explicit binary-workflow input so the
  public release command cannot push a tag and then fail GitHub dispatch
  validation.

- Installed the pinned `uv` tool before the Linux install CI job enters the
  shared package gate.

- Retried transient Tart SSH failures only before authenticated guest
  execution, while failing without replay after a native package install has
  started.
- Removed stale source-contract references to the retired asset-delta helper
  so the orthogonal release doctrine teardown remains internally executable.

## [1.5.1784808246] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Made the canonical macOS gate install its exact package in a clean Tart VM,
  verify the installed app/binaries/service, and boot a real Capsem guest from
  that package payload on the physical Mac; removed the forked `just release`
  dispatcher.

## [1.5.1784695365] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- Made headless macOS package installs prove the exact non-root target user and
  package receipt with labeled assertions, while retaining unconditional user,
  app-path, receipt, and Installer diagnostics for failed release jobs.
- Started the local Docker backend before release-gate storage preflight so a
  correctly stopped Colima daemon cannot fail qualification before bootstrap.

## [1.5.1784693563] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- Restored Colima to its pre-gate state after local release qualification,
  including failed gates, and set the three-resident-VM macOS average
  create-to-exec budget to two seconds while retaining the stricter single-VM
  latency gate.

## [1.5.1784689174] - 2026-07-21

## [1.5.1784673252] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

  and preserved service/VM logs when exception teardown precedes pytest's
  failure report.

## [1.5.1784663414] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Honored virtqueue interrupt suppression in the KVM VirtioFS worker and
  stopped raising interrupts for empty post-resume queue notifications,
  preventing lost completion wakeups during restored workspace bursts.

## [1.5.1784645585] - 2026-07-21

## [1.5.1784597803] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- Bounded linked Cargo test binaries and aged reproducible `target/` staging,
  retained useful compiler/toolchain caches under Docker pressure, reclaimed
  abandoned created containers, and rechecked daemon capacity immediately
  before the Linux package-install pytest tail.
- Released multi-gigabyte Docker stage images as soon as their consumers were
  done—including both preflight and Linux-parity host builders before the
  intervening asset rail—and calibrated the Linux package reserve separately
  from the larger asset-expansion and installed-package reserves, retaining a
  smaller private BuildKit floor once the final package builder exists and
  reclaiming unreferenced failed-rail stage tags before the next candidate.
- Released disposable install-gate incremental objects after package linking
  while retaining dependency caches, linked binaries, and package bundles;
  removed its derived stage image on every exit; and sized the runtime-only
  pytest reserve separately from compilation reserves.
- Kept Rust and npm advisory failures blocking in the scheduled/manual security
  audit while making candidate, smoke, and PR gates report external-clock
  advisory changes without reddening unrelated source commits.

## [1.5.1784493824] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Added a scheduled/manual blocking dependency-audit workflow, while keeping
  upstream RustSec clock changes out of ordinary PR and candidate gates.
- `dev-ci` skill: CI triage procedure and stop-the-line red-gate discipline
  (named diagnosis before any rerun, streaks are P0, failure classification).
- Cross-agent skill index contract test (`tests/test_agent_skill_index.py`):
  every skill must be indexed in CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md, no dangling skill
  references in any agent instruction file, discovery symlinks must resolve to
  canonical `skills/`, and both indexes must carry the AGENTS.md hard-contract
  pointer. The test runs in the PR gate's Python schema lane and in the full
  `just test` gate.

### Changed
- Pinned Rust 1.97.1 across local, CI, bootstrap, and builder environments;
  pinned external GitHub Actions to immutable commits; unified artifact
  uploads; and replaced source-built CI utilities with reviewed prebuilts.
- CI now runs on `main`, cancels only superseded PR runs, treats token-gated
  Codecov uploads as non-blocking, and uses structural web-surface smokes.
- Split `release-process` and `dev-testing` skills into sub-500-line spines
  with on-demand `references/` files (release graph, CI invariants, Apple
  signing, post-release verification, local/CI parity, test matrix, MCP debug
  tools) -- content moved verbatim.
- Brought GEMINI.md's skill index to full parity with CLAUDE.md and made both
  files' AGENTS.md pointers name the release-evidence and logger-DB hard
  contracts; indexed the previously missing `ironbank`, `dev-bug-review`,
  `meta-find-skills`, and `meta-skill-creation` skills.

### Fixed
- Bound `just test` to one clean committed `HEAD`, routed automatic benchmark
  output under `target/`, ignored new benchmark recordings until deliberately
  approved, and made missing release-site Astro fail immediately with the
  owning install step named.
- Made the public GitHub package release inert until candidate URLs, SHA-256,
  BLAKE3, and `install.sh` pass, then advance the user-visible channel.

## [1.5.1784485843] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Preserved guest command output that arrives after the control channel reports
  completion, replacing the 100 ms reader race with a bounded five-second
  transport-loss window and deterministic delayed-output regression coverage.
- Bounded Docker storage across the canonical Ironbank gate: capacity is
  checked before and after builder materialization, inactive incremental state
  is reclaimed under pressure, prior target volumes are flushed before a new
  canonical run, and successful runs flush compiler artifacts while retaining
  a bounded hot BuildKit cache.

## [1.5.1784475356] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Isolated the packaged Linux install and channel glow-up harness from ignored
  developer VM assets, forwarding the selected fixture tree through every
  repack and channel stage so local runs cannot copy multi-gigabyte root files
  into Docker temp storage while clean CI uses tiny fixtures.
- Made the install/release test-asset generator emit the same rootfs-scoped
  CycloneDX contract as production and replace stale live-host inventories,
  preventing dirty developer assets and clean CI fixtures from diverging at
  the public release-channel validator.
- Replaced cdxgen's live-host `os` inventory with a deterministic scan of the
  exported Debian guest rootfs, normalized the pinned scanner's invalid
  lowercase Sendmail license and colliding certificate subset before strict
  schema validation, and made local/public release gates reject unscoped or
  osquery-backed host OBOMs. Added an exact-SHA macOS/Linux GitHub
  materialization preflight so Cloudflare client-policy or manifest-schema
  failures stop before the multi-hour qualification gate.
- Hardened release manifest consumers against Cloudflare rejecting Python's
  default HTTP identity, taught package materialization and asset-delta checks
  to distinguish the public release graph from the legacy VM asset manifest,
  replaced the post-deploy legacy-only URL verifier with a byte/BLAKE3 checked
  dual-schema rail, and made release preparation stamp before the full local
  package gate so both schemas and the exact candidate version are exercised
  before qualification.
- Made VM asset generation stream BLAKE3 and SHA-256 together into the
  authoritative manifest, made channel assembly reuse those digests instead
  of repeatedly reopening gigabyte root files, isolated historical releases
  from current asset paths, and replaced release graph tests' real asset tree
  with deterministic prepared fixtures while retaining fail-closed local-copy
  mutation coverage.
- Pinned cdxgen 12.7.0 across local and CI asset rails, captured successful
  scanner chatter, and forced EROFS helper containers onto the Docker host's
  native Linux platform on Intel Linux and Apple Silicon macOS so cross-guest
  builds cannot silently compress multi-gigabyte images under QEMU or overwhelm
  exact-SHA qualification with per-file output.
- Made local release glow-up staging hardlink immutable package and VM blobs
  on the same filesystem on macOS and Linux, with a tested cross-filesystem
  copy fallback, so exact-SHA qualification cannot exhaust runner disk by
  duplicating the multi-gigabyte asset cohort at the final install gate.
- Made the fail-fast hardcoded release-selection guard run with Python's
  standard library alone, so a clean qualification runner without `rg` cannot
  burn a complete candidate gate before testing begins.
- Removed the unused non-crossable librsvg introspection toolchain from Linux
  package cross-builds, and pinned both VM profiles to checksum-verified
  Antigravity CLI release artifacts after the vendor installer URL disappeared.
- Replaced privileged Docker clock mutation with a bounded Colima VM clock
  synchronizer, preventing both silent apt date skew and Docker clients hanging
  after the clock-setting container exits.
- Made local release-site graph qualification materialize profile files from
  the candidate worktree instead of the previous `HEAD`, while production
  release assembly retains immutable git-ref sourcing.
- Provisioned and preflighted `zstd` in local macOS bootstrap/doctor and the
  exact-SHA Linux qualification gate, and made host-SBOM generation fail with
  a direct prerequisite error before invoking `tar`. This closes the parity
  hole where `just test` could build every release package before discovering
  that macOS could not inspect the Linux `data.tar.zst` payloads.
- Replaced installed-update tests' retired release endpoint environment
  overrides with package-shaped `manifest-metadata.json` provenance, and made
  the hardcoded-selection guard reject either override if it returns to the
  installed test suite.
- Masked `systemd-binfmt` in privileged Linux install-test containers and made
  the local install gate prove Colima's live Rosetta registration survives the
  full systemd/package/glow-up lifecycle. The container previously flushed the
  host VM's binfmt table, making the later doctor/recipe rail fail after the
  install rail had otherwise passed.
- Made macOS bootstrap wait for registry DNS inside a real container after a
  Colima restart. A cached `alpine true` probe previously reported success
  while the VM DNS forwarder was still starting, allowing the next package
  image build to fail resolving GHCR.
- Made release qualification validate the live public manifest with the exact
  candidate runtime, and made update checks reject profile graphs that the
  runtime cannot install, including graphs missing required image revisions.
- Made the Linux doctor accept the portable native `musl-gcc` supplied by the
  supported packages instead of requiring an x86-only cross-compiler on arm64
  asset-build runners, and exercise the same check in the local Docker
  preflight before expensive release gates.
- Made local/CI release-path parity a tested project rule, documented the
  native musl doctor miss as a hard-won lesson, and required explicit
  authoritative gates for platform boundaries that cannot run locally. The
  local Linux release container now also carries and preflights the same
  `cdxgen` asset-evidence tool installed by asset CI, refreshes its base image
  from the checked-in Dockerfile, and makes `just install` verify the installed
  manifest and execute a real guest-shell marker before succeeding.
- Made the Ironbank parity rule explicit: every portable release gate is owned
  by `just test`, which now validates the frontend, docs, marketing site, and
  generated release-site channel through the same checked-in entrypoint used
  by CI and release workflows.
- Made macOS-local `just test` exercise Linux-only Rust branches in a faithful
  non-root Docker environment, fail generated-settings drift, build the real
  release-mode macOS package and both Linux packages, generate the production
  host SBOM from those exact artifacts, and execute the previously omitted
  recipe tests after VM proofs complete.
- Made exact-SHA Linux qualification require KVM for the native package without
  rejecting the structurally validated non-host package before the native
  systemd and guest-shell proof can run.
- Made parallel VM asset qualification preflight Docker daemon capacity,
  reclaim unused builder cache before extraction, and retain fully flushed,
  architecture-specific failure logs.
- Removed silent `code` selection from desktop shortcuts, the create dialog,
  the tray, CLI run/MCP commands, and MCP tools. Profile-scoped operations now
  carry an explicit or catalog-selected profile, and the UI fails closed when
  the installed profile catalog cannot be loaded.
- Made release packages materialize and validate every installed profile,
  bound exact-SHA qualification to the exact stable/nightly channel, and added
  a `just test` grep guard for current and planned profile names, channel URLs,
  package rails, and qualification calls.
- Removed the native macOS/Linux postinstall fallback to the stable manifest;
  installers now require the package-generated `manifest-metadata.json` and
  its manifest URL instead of silently changing channel when metadata is
  missing.
- Made isolated `CAPSEM_HOME` service launches bind an ephemeral gateway port,
  and made `capsem shell` wait for and pass that exact runtime endpoint to the
  TUI instead of silently falling back to another installation on port 19222.

  package with `/usr/sbin/installer`, so the command completes a real install
  instead of handing the package to a generic `open` action.
- Made both macOS and Linux public installers reject package downloads whose
  byte size or SHA-256 does not match the release manifest before elevation.
- Strengthened release CI to verify exact installed package versions, complete
  binary cohorts, service readiness, and PTY-driven `capsem shell` execution
  inside a KVM-backed guest on Linux.
- Made Debian-package SBOM inspection parse the package archive directly, so
  release acceptance tests work with both BSD and GNU host toolchains.
- Pinned the clean-build SSE stream dependency to its supported patch API so
  untracked local resolution state cannot mask release CI compilation drift.
- Made macOS CI install the release-site lockfile before integration tests so
  cached local Node modules cannot mask clean-runner release-contract failures.

## [1.5.1783894498] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- Added a Stage 0 clean-container install-harness preflight to `just test`,
  before audits/builds/VMs, plus ordering contracts and agent/skill policy. It
  proves the container-owned uv environment can launch pytest early while the
  complete Docker/systemd package install E2E remains mandatory later.

### Fixed
- Made the host exec-output transport retry interrupted socket reads instead
  of publishing an empty or partial buffer with the guest command's successful
  exit code. This prevents release replays from losing output emitted at
  process exit while preserving the real exit status.

## [1.5.1783890062] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Made the Linux install E2E harness use a container-owned uv environment and
  launch pytest through `python -m pytest`, so a bind-mounted host `.venv`
  cannot supply an invalid host-only shebang or prevent the real post-install
  suite from running in the clean systemd container.

## [1.5.1783882370] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Unified the IronBank concurrent route-health gate with the archived
  route-latency benchmark: both now execute 160 `/stats` reads alongside 24
  public profile mutations and enforce the same 0.34-second service CPU ceiling.
  This replaces the stale 96-read/12-write duplicate calibration and adds an
  explicit proof that a 0.36-second CPU regression is rejected.

## [1.5.1783877670] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Removed stale gateway runtime markers before spawning a replacement gateway,
  so rapid fixed-port service restarts cannot mistake the previous process's
  `gateway.port` file for readiness; restart-test teardown now also reaps every
  child on assertion failure and uses only isolated fixture profiles.
- Made the cleanup budget regression portable across filesystems by deriving
  its limit from allocated blocks while retaining allocated-size semantics.
- Kept the IronBank `npx` proof exact when newer npm versions print notices,
  and made the profile-mutation ledger proof cross the logger-owned graceful
  shutdown flush barrier before reading `main.db`.

## [1.5.1783872793] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Loaded `vhost_vsock` and made `/dev/vhost-vsock` accessible before the Linux
  release gate, so the complete VM and IronBank suites can boot guests on a
  KVM-capable hosted runner instead of cascading from a root-only vsock device
  into hundreds of fixture failures.

## [1.5.1783869563] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Installed the complete Linux GTK, GLib, WebKit, SSL, musl, pkg-config, X11,
  and virtual-display prerequisites before the canonical release `just test`
  gate, so its full-workspace Clippy and application compilation execute on a
  clean GitHub runner instead of failing after 33 minutes on missing
  `glib-2.0.pc`.

## [1.5.1783867436] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Kept one complete canonical `just test` release gate on Linux, then fanned
  the exact macOS and Linux package build/install jobs out only after it passed.
- Explicitly documented the temporary absence of macOS full-gate coverage:
  GitHub-hosted macOS lacks the nested virtualization required by Capsem and
  Colima, and the repository has no physical macOS runner. The signed,
  notarized exact `.pkg` install remains release-blocking, and the parallel
  macOS full gate is restored when physical runner capacity exists.

## [1.5.1783866625] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Restored the complete canonical `just test` release gate on macOS and Linux
  in parallel for every stable and nightly tag; package builds and publication
  now depend on both current-tag gates, with no local, prior-run, or selected
  test subset accepted as release evidence.
- Installed the exact notarized macOS package and exact Linux package before
  making artifacts publishable, exercising the real native installers and
  post-install scripts. The public install, channel-switch, and upgrade glow-up
  remains the mandatory end-to-end post-deployment gate; the full `just test`
  gate runs once per operating system rather than being redundantly repeated.
- Documented the full two-OS test, exact-install, and public-glow-up invariant in
  the repository agent instructions and release/testing skills.

## [1.5.1783863607] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Kept the post-deploy binary verifier anchored to the public stable installer
  while validating the selected stable or nightly package manifest, so nightly
  releases prove stable-to-nightly-to-stable switching instead of treating the
  nightly manifest as the initial stable origin.

## [1.5.1783860519] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Published a distinct nightly binary version through the same serialized,
  channel-parameterized release rail used by stable.

## [1.5.1783857731] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Kept the integration release gate hermetic in long checkout paths by using a
  short process-scoped runtime root for Unix sockets, sessions, and the logger
  index while preserving isolated config and credential state.
- Stopped duplicate full CI runs when a release commit lands on `main`; pull
  requests remain merge-gated and one explicitly dispatched, globally
  serialized workflow now releases a single requested stable or nightly
  channel.
- Installed the locked Python environment before generating release-site CI
  fixtures so declared dependencies such as `blake3` are available.
- Made release publication wait for the exact notarized macOS package and both
  release Linux packages to install successfully instead of testing a separate
  pre-release debug package.

## [1.5.1783836598] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Reused one generation timestamp across stable and nightly binary-channel
  assembly so the rendered release index and per-channel health records cannot
  drift by a second and block an otherwise valid release.

## [1.5.1783827911] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Kept the full-workspace release Clippy gate clean on Rust 1.97 by using a
  byte string in the large-body MITM integration fixture and `Option::filter`
  for absent audit TTY values.

## [1.5.1783820797] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Hardened tag-triggered release CI to run Clippy across the full workspace and
  all targets with every warning treated as a release-blocking error.
- Made macOS and Linux package-script failures write an actionable tester
  report with the failed install phase, detailed log path, and exact command to
  copy into a bug report; macOS also opens the report visibly.

## [1.5.1783742640] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Retried transient release-channel HTTP failures during asset hydration,
  binary update checks, installer downloads, and post-release validators so
  installs survive dropped connections and IPv6 no-route hosts.

## [1.5.1783732620] - 2026-07-11

## [1.5.1783712334] - 2026-07-10

## [1.5.1783696029] - 2026-07-10

## [1.5.1783686006] - 2026-07-10

## [1.5.1783554373] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Made binary-lane channel assembly materialize preserved profile config
  artifacts from the asset release source tag and verify their hashes before
  deploy, keeping stable/nightly package updates from corrupting immutable
  profile release paths.

## [1.5.1783550716] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Removed the stale macOS `cargo sbom` handoff from release artifacts and made
  channel assembly regenerate packaged host SBOM evidence from the downloaded
  `.pkg` and `.deb` files before validating stable/nightly manifests.

## [1.5.1783547869] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Made the binary release lane update graph-shaped stable and nightly channel
  manifests directly, preserving profile image metadata while replacing package
  and host SBOM evidence.
- Made `capsem-admin assets channel build` accept graph manifests as input so
  tag-triggered binary releases can rebuild channel catalog, health, and site
  output without raw VM asset manifests or image rebuilds.
- Added Linux-side macOS `.pkg` executable inventory extraction for
  productbuild XAR/CPIO payloads, keeping Ubuntu release-channel assembly able
  to publish package-owned binary hashes.
- Regenerated release SBOM evidence from packaged host artifacts before
  attestation so `capsem-sbom.spdx.json` carries SHA-256 checksums for the
  shipped `.pkg` and `.deb` executables.

## [1.5.1783543478] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Made public install and download entrypoints resolve stable release-channel
  packages instead of GitHub's asset tag page, keeping `.pkg` and `.deb`
  downloads on the binary release rail.
- Split binary package publication from VM image/profile asset publication so
  stable and nightly binaries can move independently while continuing to use
  the current EROFS/lz4hc image assets.
- Made runtime asset updates and package-build profile materialization accept
  release-channel profile manifests, preserve their exact image artifact URLs,
  and write validated raw v2 asset manifests for downstream compatibility.
- Cleared denied-warning release build failures in settings export, MCP SSE
  setup, Linux-only overlay helpers, and platform-specific `statvfs` counters.

## [1.5.1783541516] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Made service storage diagnostics accept platform-specific `statvfs` block
  counter widths so denied-warning release builds compile on macOS and Linux.

## [1.5.1783540422] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Kept the MCP HTTP client on the current SSE stream constructor and scoped
  Linux-only overlay helpers so release builds pass denied-warning checks on
  both macOS and Linux.

## [1.5.1783539702] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Made the settings generator print `target/build.log` when release CI fails
  during MCP catalog export, and package-qualified the export binary selection.

## [1.5.1783538942] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Made the public installer resolve `.pkg` and `.deb` packages from the
  stable release-channel manifest instead of GitHub's latest release pointer,
  and updated the marketing/docs download links to use the stable channel.
- Made `capsem update --assets` accept split-lane release-channel profile
  manifests, hydrate their exact VM image artifact URLs, and install a
  validated local v2 asset manifest for runtime compatibility.
- Made the tray gateway client report corrupt gateway tokens as ordinary
  request errors instead of panicking its background poller.

## [1.5.1783439394] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- Split the binary release rail across stable and nightly manifests for the
  first 1.5 publish, proving package/SBOM metadata can move without rebuilding
  or mutating VM image/profile metadata.
- Added a manifest history audit regression proving retained channel manifest
  records use status enums, full digests, and never publish `removed`.
- Added a public release HMAC regression proving generated release pages and
  JSON graph inventory expose only SHA-256 and BLAKE3 digest fields.
- Added a release-site canonical URL regression proving human pages expose
  `/assets/<channel>/manifest.json` and not versioned manifest fetch endpoints.
- Added a release-site generation regression proving profile catalog side
  channels stay out of the public pages and graph.
- Added an adversarial software inventory regression proving distinct package
  rows cannot share identical SHA-256/BLAKE3 digest pairs.
- Added a software inventory hash regression proving each row owns distinct
  SHA-256 and BLAKE3 values instead of reusing inventory evidence digests.
- Added a software inventory version regression proving profile package rows
  reject missing, unknown, unversioned, and fallback versions.
- Added a software inventory evidence regression proving each architecture
  links its inventory once and keeps row hashes row-owned.
- Added a profile page architecture regression proving package, config, image,
  and evidence records stay in their owning architecture blocks.
- Added a profile software architecture regression proving software inventory
  rows live under architecture nodes and never render as architecture `all`.
- Added a binary description regression proving executable descriptions come
  from generated metadata and never from release-site fallback text.
- Added a macOS package cohort regression proving the package owns app, tray,
  helper, gateway, service, MCP, TUI, admin, and CLI executable inventory rows.
- Added a binary SBOM reference regression proving binary rows keep component
  refs and do not repeat package SBOM file links.
- Added a package SBOM owner-level regression proving SBOM links render once
  on the owning package page and not on each binary row.
- Added a package detail navigation regression proving every manifest package
  has a generated package page linked from its channel page.
- Added a channel package table regression proving package rows render under
  explicit OS/architecture sections with no architecture-all fallback.
- Added a package-target regression proving channel manifests and pages group
  Capsem packages by explicit operating system and architecture JSON fields.
- Added a manifest-version independence regression proving channel manifest
  versions stay separate from binary package and profile asset versions.
- Added a root channel metadata regression proving the table uses manifest
  version, last updated, and manifest URL labels without selected/status/records jargon.
- Added a root channel page regression proving stable/nightly rows render
  descriptions once and do not repeat raw channel identifiers.
- Added a human hash display regression proving release-site pages truncate
  SHA-256 and BLAKE3 values to 8-character prefixes while machine JSON stays full.
- Added a named Codecov binary/release-target regression proving CI covers
  executable targets, release-critical components, and package rail tests.
- Added a named Codecov crate reporting regression proving every Rust
  workspace crate source directory appears in the uploaded coverage surface.
- Added a named profile evidence scoping regression proving ABOM and OBOM
  evidence stays under profile image artifacts, not loose channel/profile evidence.
- Added a named profile image bundle regression proving each profile
  architecture renders the complete kernel, initrd, and rootfs artifact set.
- Added a named profile config inventory regression proving security,
  detection, MCP, package-manager, build, tips, and root manifest config files render.
- Added a named software-inventory real-version regression proving profile
  software rows reject missing, latest, unknown, and unversioned placeholders.
- Added a named macOS package binary cohort regression covering app, tray,
  helper, CLI, hashes, installed paths, and SBOM component refs.
- Added a named package-owned-binaries regression so package detail pages list
  only the executable files inside the selected package target.
- Added a package SBOM owner-level regression proving package pages keep SBOM
  evidence in package metadata instead of repeating it on binary rows.
- Added a named channel package grouping regression proving package rows stay
  under OS/architecture target sections on channel pages.
- Added a manifest package-target gate proving package and binary rows carry
  explicit operating-system and architecture coordinates in machine JSON.
- Added a manifest-version independence gate so channel manifest versions stay
  separate from Capsem package, profile, and VM asset/image versions.
- Added a named root-channel last-updated regression so channel rows keep
  manifest revision/update metadata and reject status/records columns.
- Added a named root-channel duplicate-id regression so stable/nightly rows
  render metadata descriptions instead of repeating raw channel identifiers.
- Fixed the local release-site contract checker so filesystem release outputs
  validate stable and nightly channel pages without stale asset-version or
  production-only HTTP header assumptions.
- Added an ABOM/OBOM image-scope gate so profile evidence must point at the
  owning architecture path and cannot leak into channel or generic evidence tables.
- Added a profile-image completeness gate so every profile architecture must
  publish kernel, initrd, and rootfs artifacts before release validation passes.
- Added a profile software inventory regression proving software rows are
  scoped to architecture blocks and never flattened as architecture `all`.
- Added explicit release-site labels for profile config enum values so rendered
  config tables no longer pass arbitrary kind strings through as UI labels.
- Added a profile config inventory regression proving every architecture renders
  MCP, enforcement, detection, package-manager, build, tips, and root manifest files.
- Added a byte-backed package/binary hash regression covering package SBOM
  artifact digests and binary SHA-256 component checksums from SPDX evidence.
- Added a SHA1-only SBOM regression proving SPDX file evidence must include
  SHA-256 checksums; SHA1 is ignored as upstream noise, not trusted evidence.
- Added a Linux package cohort regression proving each Debian architecture
  owns the full Capsem binary set with paths, digests, and SBOM refs.
- Added a macOS package cohort regression proving app, tray, CLI, service,
  gateway, MCP, and TUI binaries are package-owned with paths, digests, and SBOM refs.
- Added a package-detail SBOM regression proving package evidence is rendered
  once while binary rows show only their SBOM component references.
- Added a package-architecture regression proving channel package grouping uses
  explicit JSON platform/architecture fields even when the package filename lies.
- Added a profile/image revision SemVer gate and admin validation so profile
  payload versions are channel-scoped release coordinates, not date strings.
- Added a profile-image removal gate proving image removal is represented by
  omission from the current profile and `status: removed` is rejected.
- Added a nightly binary/package isolation gate proving binary updates do not
  mutate profile, stable, or channel state.
- Added a co-work nightly profile isolation gate proving profile updates do not
  mutate stable, code, package, binary, or sibling architecture state.
- Added a stable-to-nightly manifest URL switch gate and channel identity in
  graph manifests so clients can validate selected channel state without a side registry.
- Added an immutable manifest-history gate proving old channel manifest records
  stay addressable while current uses the canonical asset URL.
- Hardened the release-graph status enum gate so `removed`, `payload_status`,
  and deprecated boolean fields cannot survive in generated graph JSON.
- Hardened the root channel update-time gate so channel rows show generated
  provenance and never reintroduce Status/Records noise.
- Hardened the root channel-description review gate so stable/nightly copy is
  rendered from channel metadata in the matching channel row.
- Added a release-site content validator regression proving remote deploy checks
  package-detail and profile-artifact page values, not just file existence.
- Added a named Codecov crate-and-binary enumeration gate covering workspace
  crates, binary targets, Codecov components, `--bins`, and package rail tests.
- Added a generated-from-JSON release-site gate proving root, channel, package,
  binary, profile, software, config, image, and evidence cells render owner JSON.
- Added a named placeholder-or-copied-hash gate covering fake digest patterns,
  copied row digests, and duplicate digest reuse across release artifacts.
- Added a full-site digest display regression so human release pages must show
  SHA-256 and BLAKE3 values as short labels without leaking full machine hashes.
- Hardened the ABOM/OBOM architecture-scope gate so profile pages render image
  evidence in the image-owned block, not generic profile evidence.
- Hardened the profile image artifact gate so every architecture-local image
  block renders each image artifact's kind, name, URL, and digests.
- Added a named all-config-classes gate covering rendered profile config
  classes and source TOML-owned security, detection, and MCP config paths.
- Added a named real-software-versions gate covering forbidden software
  versions, row-owned hashes, and inventory-digest reuse rejection.
- Added a named review gate proving software inventory evidence appears once
  per profile architecture rather than repeating on every software row.
- Hardened the software architecture scope gate so rendered profile software
  sections cannot show `all` instead of concrete profile architectures.
- Hardened the profile architecture section gate so every current stable and
  nightly profile page must render profile-owned architecture sections.
- Hardened the binary-description release gate so every package page renders
  source-owned binary descriptions for both stable and nightly packages.
- Added a named owned-binary-cohort gate proving package detail pages list all
  binaries owned by each package while channel pages stay package-focused.
- Added a package-target parity gate requiring current channel manifests and
  channel pages to include macOS arm64 and Linux arm64/x86_64 packages.
- Added a named package-target SBOM regression gate so every package row must
  expose the SBOM evidence owned by that package target.
- Added a release-site review regression that rejects profile catalog files
  and profile-catalog page links as a second profile registry.
- Added a release-site review regression that rejects versioned manifest paths
  and profile-catalog links as alternate client entrypoints.
- Labeled channel-page manifest versions explicitly so package versions,
  profile revisions, and manifest versions stay visually separated.
- Added a release-site review regression gate for root channel table semantics
  so Selected/Status/Records labels cannot return.
- Removed hardcoded release-site channel description fallbacks so root channel
  descriptions are rendered only from channel metadata.
- Added a binary-target coverage workflow gate that derives executable-owning
  crates from Cargo metadata and verifies CI coverage includes them.
- Added an adversarial Codecov component contract that fails when a workspace
  crate path disappears from coverage reporting.
- Appended Python release/package integration tests to the uploaded coverage
  report so package rail coverage is visible in Codecov.
- Added release-site coverage generation and Codecov upload wiring so the
  Astro release channel surface is visible in PR coverage reports.
- Required Rust coverage workflows and local coverage recipes to include
  binary targets with `--bins`.
- Split low-coverage MCP aggregator, MCP builtin, process, and mock-server
  crates into dedicated Codecov components with explicit project targets.
- Added a named Codecov component contract that fails when any Cargo workspace
  crate path is missing from `codecov.yml`.
- Added a top-level CI coverage contract that enumerates Cargo workspace crates
  and release binary targets from `cargo metadata`, then verifies macOS
  coverage commands include every owning package.
- Added named root channel metadata gates for generated and HTML release-site
  output, and moved stable/nightly descriptions into the release graph fixture
  so the root page text is JSON-owned.
- Added a named root release-channel metadata gate proving the index renders
  manifest revision, update time, package/profile coverage, architectures, and
  canonical manifest URLs without Selected/Status/Records noise.
- Hardened the release-site readiness checker so stale generated HTML is
  rejected when channel pages stop matching the source channel, manifest,
  package, profile, and package-owned binary JSON values.
- Added a release-site graph mutation gate proving Astro pages render channel,
  package, binary, profile, software, and image fields from the JSON graph, and
  made the local `build:channel` gate build against the checked-in fixture when
  no release-channel output path is provided.
- Added a named release-site gate proving generated pages and release-site
  loaders do not reintroduce a profile catalog side channel.
- Added an explicit release manifest-version rail so channel manifests publish
  `version` values independently from Capsem package versions, VM asset
  versions, profile revisions, and profile image revisions.
- Added an independent release-version matrix gate and explicit profile
  architecture package-inventory and image revision fields so manifest,
  package, profile, software-inventory, and image versions can move separately.
- Fixed the release-channel deploy validation rail so Cloudflare checks stable
  and nightly content through the public domain, preserves package metadata
  from graph manifests, accepts generated profile config enums, and validates
  package-owned SBOM evidence.
- Added a stable/nightly switch gate proving canonical channel manifest URLs
  resolve distinct package and profile state without cross-channel contamination.
- Added a nightly co-work profile isolation gate proving a profile architecture
  update does not mutate stable, code, sibling architectures, packages, or binaries.
- Added a release-lane independence gate proving profile updates mutate only
  the selected profile payload while package and binary inventories stay fixed.
- Added a release-lane independence gate proving binary/package updates mutate
  package-owned data without changing profile payloads or other channels.
- Added a named copied-inventory digest gate proving software rows do not reuse
  software-inventory evidence hashes.
- Added a named release-site digest display gate proving human pages truncate
  hashes while machine JSON keeps full SHA-256/BLAKE3 values.
- Repaired the stable/nightly release graph fixture so shared software
  inventory evidence uses canonical asset URLs and distinct rendered inventory
  rows cannot reuse digests for different subjects.
- Rejected repeated release-graph digests across distinct software rows and
  profile artifact entries so copied hash evidence cannot pass validation.
- Rejected placeholder release digests in readiness validation so repeated
  one-character SHA-256/BLAKE3 values cannot pass as release evidence.
- Rebuilt the release-channel contract around generated channel, manifest,
  package, binary, profile, image, and evidence ownership; added multichannel
  stable/nightly generation and live `release.capsem.org` verification gates
  with real SHA-256 and BLAKE3 artifact checks.
- Hardened the generated release-site display contract so root/channel pages use
  current manifest language, hide legacy profile-catalog side links, truncate
  human-facing hashes, keep SBOM evidence on package rows, and require packages
  to own executable binary inventory in release-channel tests.
- Added named release-site HTML gate tests for Sprinty closure and serialized
  Astro fixture builds so concurrent release-site contract checks cannot corrupt
  `build_system/release_site/dist`.
- Added named release architecture and package/binary contract gates for the
  canonical channel manifest URL, package-owned executable inventory, and
  package-level SBOM evidence.
- Documented and gated the release graph invariant hierarchy from channels to
  packages/binaries and profiles/architecture-scoped payloads.
- Documented and gated independent release version surfaces so package,
  profile, and profile-image updates can move without mutating each other.
- Documented and gated the single release status enum across graph status
  fields, with no `removed` status.
- Added a release hash/evidence gate that rejects HMAC fields in the public
  release graph.
- Added a generated release-site ownership gate so root, channel, and profile
  pages cannot display facts owned by a different JSON object.
- Grouped release-channel package tables by package architecture on the
  generated channel pages.
- Added a release package gate that requires the macOS `.pkg` package to appear
  in the package inventory and generated channel page.
- Added a package-owned binary cohort gate requiring each release package to
  list the expected Capsem executables.
- Split the root release channel page from host package versions by rendering
  independent manifest revisions from `channels.json`.
- Replaced root release-channel history/record noise with generated update and
  package/profile/architecture coverage metadata.
- Split generated release-channel package tables by explicit architecture and
  platform target so host packages are not grouped into ambiguous architecture
  buckets.
- Required package-scoped SBOM evidence for each generated release package
  instead of cloning the global host SBOM into every package row.
- Made generated package detail pages identify the selected package and guard
  against leaking sibling package binaries or evidence.
- Moved release-channel binary descriptions into generated package metadata and
  required the release site to render those descriptions from machine JSON.
- Rendered package-owned binary targets from the owning package architecture and
  platform instead of hiding target information from human release pages.
- Added a named package-detail rendering gate proving package SBOM evidence is
  shown once at the package level and not repeated on binary rows.
- Added a named package SBOM contract gate so Sprinty verifies per-target
  package SBOM evidence instead of relying on broad test selection.
- Removed the release profile page fallback to binary compatibility metadata so
  profiles expose only profile-owned minimum Capsem requirements.
- Moved generated profile release payloads under architecture-owned software,
  config, image, and evidence blocks, and updated release-site validation so
  human pages keep one canonical manifest URL while machine catalogs retain
  immutable audit records.
- Rendered release-channel package groups as explicit OS/architecture package
  targets and added Linux amd64 fixture coverage alongside macOS arm64 and
  Linux arm64 packages.
- Required every release package to generate a detail page with the package
  target, hashes, SBOM evidence, and owned binary inventory rendered from the
  machine graph.
- Expanded release-package binary inventory fixtures and gates so every package
  lists the full Capsem executable cohort, including app, tray, CLI, service,
  process, TUI, MCP, gateway, and admin binaries.
- Kept package SBOM evidence on the package detail evidence block, with binary
  rows limited to SBOM component references instead of repeating evidence URLs.
- Added package SBOM fixture files and gates that prove every package-owned
  binary SBOM component reference resolves inside the owning package SBOM with
  SHA-256 checksums matching the binary inventory.
- Required channel package target rows to show each target package SBOM link,
  byte count, SHA-256, and BLAKE3 evidence instead of a partial shared digest.
- Removed the flattened channel-level binary table so executable inventory is
  rendered only on the owning package detail pages.
- Corrected profile architecture evidence so ABOM, OBOM, and software
  inventory are scoped to the profile architecture that owns them.
- Required profile software inventory rows to carry real package versions,
  rejecting placeholder values in generated graph validation and remote
  release-site readiness checks.
- Added the named Sprinty gate for real profile software versions so empty,
  `unversioned`, `unknown`, and `latest` rows fail release readiness checks.
- Added named release-contract gates proving profile lists come from channel
  manifests without a detached profile catalog side channel.
- Moved profile ABOM, OBOM, and software-inventory evidence links to the top of
  each profile architecture block and stopped repeating evidence URLs on
  software rows.
- Normalized release package architecture metadata to the profile graph's
  canonical `x86_64` spelling so package availability joins by channel
  architecture instead of profile-owned package theater.
- Added a named software-evidence scope gate proving profile software rows do
  not repeat architecture-level evidence URLs.
- Added named profile and hash-evidence gates proving each architecture renders
  one software-inventory evidence link while software rows keep row-owned
  digests.
- Required profile software row digests to be derived from the row's
  name/version/source/architecture/evidence tuple instead of copied inventory
  or placeholder hashes.
- Rejected profile software rows that copy the architecture software-inventory
  file digest in both release graph validation and remote release readiness.
- Attached profile ABOM and OBOM links to the profile image block for each
  architecture while keeping software inventory evidence at the architecture
  evidence header.
- Added a named profile image evidence gate proving ABOM and OBOM links stay
  in the owning architecture image block and do not leak onto channel pages.
- Renamed profile architecture software tables to installed software and added
  a gate proving channel package names and URLs do not leak into profile
  installed-inventory blocks.
- Added a named profile page section-boundary gate proving installed software,
  config files, image artifacts, and image evidence render in separate
  architecture-owned blocks.
- Added a named profile manifest-shape gate proving architecture software,
  config, image, and evidence lists stay distinct without an ambiguous
  profile-owned package bucket.
- Added a named profile config-class gate proving generated profile pages
  render profile, MCP, enforcement, detection, package-manager, build, tips,
  and root-manifest config entries.
- Added a named config inventory gate proving release profile config artifacts
  match canonical profile TOML file definitions, including enforcement and
  detection rule files.
- Updated asset-channel validation to require OS/architecture package target
  sections and package detail links instead of the removed flattened channel
  binary table, unblocking generated release-output contract checks.
- Replaced profile config kind strings with a release graph enum and updated
  remote readiness validation to reject unknown config categories.
- Added a full-machine-digest gate proving release graph JSON keeps complete
  SHA-256 and BLAKE3 digests for manifests, packages, binaries, profile
  config, images, software rows, ABOM, OBOM, and software inventory evidence.

## [1.4.1782944059] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Kept VM asset file inventory out of the compact update target in
  `release.capsem.org/health.json` so existing 1.4 clients can parse the
  channel and discover binary updates.

## [1.4.1782940516] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Clarified the binary self-update bootstrap boundary: installs that predate the
  packaged binary updater require one manual installer upgrade before they can
  follow the decoupled daily binary update rail.

## [1.4.1782934218] - 2026-07-01

## [1.4.1782928920] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Fixed URL-backed release packages so remote asset manifests are fetched with
  the release validator user-agent and templated `{asset_version}` asset bases
  survive URL validation before VM asset hydration.
- Fixed macOS package assembly so the `Capsem.app` bundle version must match
  the package version before a `.pkg` can be built.
- Fixed live VM asset release discipline so `dry_run=false` preflights that the
  configured Cloudflare account/token can see the `release-eq7` Pages project
  before building VM images, publishing immutable asset blobs, or attesting them.
- Fixed release-channel deploy validation so Cloudflare publishes must run the
  Python release-site contract checker against `release.capsem.org`, validating
  content, evidence, hashes, attestations, and cache headers rather than only
  file presence.
- Fixed the release-channel reusable workflow contract so Cloudflare secrets are
  declared on `workflow_call` before the manual VM asset workflow invokes it.
- Fixed binary and VM asset release workflow permissions so callers grant
  `deployments: write` before invoking the reusable release-channel deploy.
- Fixed the VM asset release upload plan so dry-runs and live publishes include
  only real architecture artifacts, not `assets/current` compatibility aliases.
- Fixed the release-channel deploy workflow and release docs so
  `release.capsem.org` deploys to the actual Cloudflare Pages project
  `release-eq7`.
- Fixed the PR CI macOS non-VM integration lane so it codesigns the
  `capsem-bench-rs` binary produced by the `capsem-bench` package instead of a
  nonexistent `capsem-bench` executable.
- Fixed release-channel generation, validation, live smoke, and remote readiness
  so VM asset attestations must point at the published VM OBOM predicate
  evidence instead of passing with an omitted predicate URL.
- Fixed the release-process and asset-pipeline skills so they preserve the VM
  asset attestation predicate URL requirement for published VM OBOM evidence.
- Fixed the CI/release documentation so it preserves the VM asset attestation
  predicate URL requirement for published VM OBOM evidence.
- Fixed the asset-pipeline architecture documentation so it preserves the
  release-channel SBOM, VM OBOM, and VM asset attestation evidence contract.
- Fixed release-channel validation, live smoke, and remote readiness so host
  SBOM evidence must stay on the canonical `capsem-sbom.spdx.json` row and the
  host SBOM attestation must point at that evidence.
- Fixed release-channel validation, live smoke, and remote readiness so host
  SBOM and VM OBOM evidence must be valid SPDX 2.3 or CycloneDX documents, not
  just hash-matching files.
- Fixed release-channel validation, live smoke, and remote readiness so
  attestation evidence scope and workflow metadata cannot drift from the
  canonical host binary, host SBOM, or VM asset release rails.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so the immutable profile
  catalog artifact's state, current binary/assets targets, and compatibility
  fields cannot drift from `health.json` and the active channel manifest.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so the immutable profile
  catalog artifact is fetched and checked against its advertised BLAKE3 hash,
  schema, revision, and URL policy.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so current host binary
  package URLs, SHA-256 hashes, and sizes in `health.json` and release evidence
  cannot drift from the fetched channel manifest.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so current VM asset file
  URLs, BLAKE3 hashes, and sizes in `health.json` cannot drift from the fetched
  channel manifest.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so VM asset compatibility
  and newer-version flags cannot drift from the channel manifest's current
  asset release.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so profile catalog
  compatibility minima and newer-version flags cannot drift from the channel
  manifest.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so asset release history,
  deprecation state, deprecation dates, and minimum binary compatibility cannot
  drift from the channel manifest.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so stale `health.json`
  summary state cannot advertise the wrong channel, publication state, release
  URLs, or top-level binary/assets versions.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so image freshness remains
  explicitly unpublished until image release metadata is actually added to the
  asset channel.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so binary update target,
  state, source, and package file metadata cannot drift from the canonical
  tag-triggered binary metadata in `health.json`.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so VM asset update target,
  manifest, base URL, compatibility, and newer-version requirements cannot
  drift from the canonical asset channel metadata in `health.json`.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so profile update hash,
  compatibility, and newer-version requirements cannot drift from the canonical
  profile catalog metadata in `health.json`.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so
  `updates.profiles.source` must match the profile catalog source advertised to
  humans and machine readers.
- Fixed live release-site smoke/readiness validation so stale public index pages
  are rejected when profile catalog, generated timestamp, or channel manifest
  metadata drift from `health.json`.
- Fixed release-channel validation so a stale human `index.html` cannot pass
  while `/health.json` and the channel manifest advertise newer release state.
- Fixed the release-readiness docs and skills so the live activation order names
  the fail-closed remote `pr-gate` shape required before branch protection.
- Fixed the remote release readiness checker so it rejects `pr-gate` workflows
  that aggregate jobs but do not run fail-closed and assert every dependency
  result.
- Fixed the remote release readiness checker so malformed live release-site
  contract objects fail with explicit diagnostics instead of a Python exception.
- Fixed the release-process skill and Debian repack header so they document the
  `.deb` pre-install shutdown rail before binary replacement.
- Fixed the installation skill so it documents the Linux `.deb` pre-install
  restart rail that stops stale helpers before package replacement.
- Fixed Linux package self-updates so the repacked `.deb` carries a pre-install
  shutdown script for stale service, gateway, tray, and helper processes before
  binary replacement.
- Fixed the installation skill so it documents the full packaged host binary
  cohort and version-surface check used by installed update smokes.
- Fixed the remaining packaged admin and MCP helper binaries so they expose a
  package-version surface for installed update cohort verification.
- Fixed the install-layout test harness so it verifies every packaged host
  binary reports the installed Capsem package version.
- Fixed the gateway and tray helper binaries so they expose `--version` for
  installed update cohort verification.
- Fixed the service update routes so ambiguous JSON bodies with extra fields are
  rejected instead of silently checking or applying binary/profile or VM asset
  updates.
- Fixed CLI update-status formatting coverage so `capsem status` keeps
  available and blocked binary/profile/VM asset/image tracks separated.
- Fixed the binary release post-deploy smoke so asset-channel URLs must match
  the BLAKE3 hashes advertised by the public manifest, not just return HTTP 200.
- Fixed the VM asset workflow metadata preservation step so its writable local
  manifest path is not passed through the URL-only `--manifest` source flag.
- Fixed release-channel live smoke/readiness validation so host SBOM
  attestations must cover every published host package subject.
- Fixed release-channel validation so host SBOM attestations must cover every
  published host package subject.
- Fixed release-channel validation so host SBOM evidence must include matching
  host SBOM attestation metadata, not just package provenance.
- Fixed the tag-triggered binary release summary so it reports host SBOM
  attestation coverage for both `.pkg` and `.deb` package subjects.
- Fixed the tag-triggered binary release workflow so the canonical host SBOM
  attestation covers both macOS `.pkg` and Linux `.deb` package subjects.
- Fixed the tag-triggered binary release workflow so release-channel assembly
  preflights the canonical host SBOM and installable package artifacts before
  recording binary metadata.
- Fixed binary release metadata recording so only the canonical
  `capsem-sbom.spdx.json` artifact satisfies the host SBOM evidence
  requirement for the release channel.
- Fixed binary release metadata recording so package artifact filenames must
  match the binary version being advertised in the release channel.
- Fixed binary release metadata recording so zero-byte host package or SBOM
  artifacts are rejected before their hashes can be published to the release
  channel.
- Fixed binary release metadata recording so arbitrary non-SBOM files cannot
  satisfy the installable host package requirement; only `.pkg` and `.deb`
  artifacts count as host packages.
- Fixed binary release metadata recording so a release cannot update the
  release channel with only host SBOM evidence and no installable host package
  artifact.
- Fixed the manual VM asset release workflow so asset-channel builds preserve
  live binary release metadata, host SBOM references, and binary attestation
  state instead of replacing them with a freshly generated binary section.
- Fixed VM asset release delta checks so manifest policy changes such as
  `refresh_policy` deploy the release channel without republishing VM blobs.
- Fixed current VM asset release metadata comparisons so compatibility/date
  updates deploy the release channel without republishing unchanged VM blobs.
- Fixed the manual VM asset release delta so asset release metadata changes
  deploy the release channel without republishing unchanged immutable VM blobs.
- Matched attestation predicate URL validation to the correct evidence rail so
  VM asset provenance can point at VM OBOM evidence while host package
  attestations continue to point at host SBOM evidence.
- Rejected release-channel health indexes whose VM asset attestation predicate
  URL points outside the published VM OBOM evidence list.

### Changed
- Clarified that the first asset-channel bootstrap may omit host binary
  evidence until the tag-triggered binary rail publishes package files and host
  SBOM metadata, while later missing host SBOM evidence remains
  release-blocking.
- Removed the manual VM asset release `binary_version` override so asset
  releases preserve, but do not author, binary release metadata.
- Clarified VM asset no-op guidance so manifest policy changes such as
  `refresh_policy` deploy `release.capsem.org` without VM blob publication.
- Clarified VM asset release guidance so metadata-only asset channel changes
  deploy `release.capsem.org` without requiring immutable blob upload plans.
- Clarified manual VM asset no-op guidance so unchanged blob hashes alone do
  not imply a skipped release-channel deploy.
- Updated the remote release readiness checker to require the expanded
  `pr-gate` contract that includes docs and marketing builds.
- Moved docs and marketing PR build enforcement under the required `pr-gate`
  status while keeping the docs and marketing Cloudflare workflows as
  push-to-main deploy rails.
- Aligned self-update docs and skills with the implemented `capsem update --yes`
  behavior: verified `.pkg` and `.deb` installers are applied through the
  platform package manager rather than only printed.

### Added
- Added remote-readiness coverage for the first asset-channel bootstrap without
  host binary evidence while preserving the release-blocking host SBOM check
  once binary files are published.
- Added the live release activation order for publishing release-rail commits,
  enabling `pr-gate`, provisioning `release.capsem.org`, and sequencing binary,
  VM asset, and installed update smokes across release and asset-pipeline
  guidance.
- Added release-channel Cloudflare prerequisites for the `capsem-release` Pages
  project, `release.capsem.org` custom domain, and required deploy secrets
  across release and asset-pipeline guidance.
- Added asset-pipeline skill guidance that corporate VM asset channels use the
  same URL-only `--manifest` update contract as the public release channel.
- Added service-route regression coverage proving confirmed binary/profile
  updates and VM asset refreshes dispatch separate CLI commands.
- Added service and gateway update action routes that expose dry-run command
  plans for release checks, binary/profile updates, and VM asset refreshes
  while requiring explicit confirmation for live apply.
- Added profile-dashboard release-state rows for profile catalog, VM asset, and
  VM image freshness so new-session actions stay distinct from binary app
  updates.
- Added TUI update status and confirmed update actions for binary/profile
  updates and VM asset refreshes.
- Added compatible profile catalog application from the release channel so
  `capsem update` can refresh `~/.capsem/profiles` independently of binary and
  VM asset releases.
- Added canonical `release.capsem.org` endpoint URLs for the human index,
  health JSON, manifest, profile catalog, and asset base to the generated
  release-channel page and machine health index.
- Added asset release dates to the generated release-channel index and health
  JSON so `release.capsem.org` shows when each VM asset release was cut.
- Added release-channel deploy smoke coverage that rejects a public
  `release.capsem.org` index whose binary, VM asset, or asset date state is
  stale relative to the live health JSON and manifest.
- Added CI docs coverage noting that remote release readiness verifies live
  cache headers for mutable release-channel pointers and immutable artifacts.
- Added a dry-run `asset-release-plan` artifact for manual VM asset releases so
  reviewers can inspect the generated immutable GitHub Release upload commands.
- Added an `asset-release-delta` artifact for manual VM asset releases so
  changed and no-op dry runs preserve the manifest comparison decision.
- Added CI docs plus release-process and asset-pipeline skill guidance for
  dated asset release history and stale public index rejection.
- Added a read-only remote release readiness checker for `pr-gate`, branch
  protection/rulesets, DNS, and release-channel endpoint agreement.
- Added binary self-update package execution for verified macOS `.pkg` and
  Linux `.deb` installers when `capsem update --yes` finds a newer release.
- Added frontend release-channel evidence links for host SBOM, VM OBOM, and
  binary/VM asset attestations in the Settings/About update surface.
- Added VM asset provenance attestation references to the release-channel
  evidence index alongside OBOM and binary SBOM evidence.
- Added attestation predicate and verification command metadata to the
  release-channel evidence index so SBOM/OBOM/provenance checks are easier to
  audit from `release.capsem.org`.
- Added supply-chain evidence to update status responses, including manifest
  origin/hash, channel index hash, host SBOM, VM OBOM, and attestation
  references for UI, tray, TUI, and support-bundle consumers.
- Added explicit profile update semantics to profile list and status APIs so
  UI, tray, and TUI consumers know new sessions use the current profile catalog
  while existing VMs stay pinned until recreated.
- Published profile catalog revision, hash, source, and compatibility metadata
  in the release-channel index so profile freshness is no longer represented as
  an unpublished track.
- Stored release-channel cache provenance for update checks, including the
  fetched channel hash, validation status, and validation errors exposed through
  the update status API.
- Recorded package manifest snapshot provenance with fetched time, snapshot
  SHA-256, and package release version in installed manifest-origin metadata.
- Added install-side verification that `capsem update` fetches the release
  channel health index and writes validated channel cache provenance.
- Added install-side verification that corporate manifest origins derive their
  own release health endpoint while using the same update cache provenance as
  the public channel.
- Added install-side verification that profile catalog updates leave existing
  VM asset pin registries and installed asset manifests untouched.
- Added frontend update-status coverage for mixed binary and VM asset update
  summaries without treating binary releases as profile state.
- Added tray menu coverage for mixed binary and VM asset update state.
- Added TUI smoke-matrix coverage for mixed binary and VM asset update state.
- Added release-doctor coverage for the binary release package hydration smoke
  against public release.capsem.org asset URLs.
- Added release-doctor coverage that binary tag releases update release-channel
  metadata without rebuilding or publishing VM asset payloads.
- Added release-doctor coverage that package update scripts replace and restart
  the full app/service/gateway/tray helper cohort together.
- Added release-doctor coverage that prevents the binary release package
  hydration smoke from silently skipping missing `.deb` packages or bundled CLI
  binaries.
- Added release-doctor coverage that keeps staged cross-surface update smoke
  prerequisites visible across CLI, service, tray, frontend UI, and TUI tests.
- Added an installed CLI staged update-state matrix covering binary-only,
  asset-only, profile-only, and mixed binary plus VM asset release-channel
  states.
- Added CLI update unit coverage proving public and corporate update source
  flags share the same URL-only validation contract.
- Added service-route coverage proving corporate config source URLs reject bare
  filesystem paths across validate and edit endpoints.
- Added release-channel cache-header documentation coverage so CI docs,
  architecture docs, and agent skills stay aligned with the deploy smoke.
- Added release-doctor coverage that binary releases do not publish
  `latest.json` updater metadata and rely on release-channel health instead.
- Fixed the CI docs thin-package contract to state that installers carry host
  binaries and the selected manifest while VM assets stay remote.
- Proxied update status through the gateway so UI, tray, and TUI surfaces can
  read release-channel freshness state.
- Published profile catalog artifacts under the asset channel with portable
  release URLs so public profile metadata no longer exposes build-machine
  paths.

### Changed
- Changed docs and marketing workflows so every push to `main` redeploys and
  smokes the public sites while pull-request builds remain path-filtered.
- Changed release-process skill guidance to match the docs and marketing
  every-main-merge deploy rail.
- Changed docs and marketing site skills to preserve the every-main-merge
  deploy rail independently from binary and VM asset releases.
- Changed update status reporting so VM asset and image tracks can surface
  blocked release-channel candidates, including asset releases that require a
  newer Capsem binary.
- Changed profile catalog updates so `capsem update` reports available
  catalogs without applying them, while `capsem update --yes` performs the
  validated apply.
- Changed `capsem update` and `capsem update --check` output to report VM
  image track state separately and distinguish unknown installed VM assets from
  available VM asset updates.
- Guarded startup asset cleanup so deprecated VM asset releases cannot remove
  persistent VM boot asset pins while still allowing unpinned deprecated blobs
  to be cleaned up.
- Changed VM asset selection to skip deprecated asset releases for new
  sessions and asset hydration while showing deprecated releases in the
  generated release-channel history.
- Changed generated release-channel cache headers so mutable channel pointers
  remain no-cache while immutable asset and profile release artifacts are
  long-lived immutable.
- Replaced the placeholder frontend update helper with typed update check and
  apply actions backed by the service-owned release update routes.
- Changed update checks to use a non-mutating `capsem update --check` path so
  service/UI freshness probes refresh release-channel status without applying
  binary, profile, corporate config, or VM asset changes.
- Changed `capsem update` to reject `--assets --corp` so corporate VM asset
  channels flow through the same `--manifest <URL>` provenance path as public
  release-channel updates.
- Added release-index contract coverage proving manual VM asset releases update
  the asset channel without moving the current binary pointer.
- Added CLI integration coverage that keeps `capsem update --manifest` and
  `--corp` URL-only, while still allowing `file://` overrides for local
  corporate/update endpoints.
- Guarded binary release channel updates so profile catalog artifacts publish
  without rebuilding VM assets.
- Changed manual VM asset releases to publish GitHub build provenance
  attestations for kernel, initrd, rootfs, and OBOM artifacts.
- Changed manual VM asset releases to publish immutable `assets-v...` GitHub
  Releases with arch-prefixed VM blobs before deploying the channel.
- Updated binary tag releases to record package, SBOM, and attestation metadata
  in the release channel without rebuilding VM assets.
- Documented the PR `pr-gate` contract against `just test`, including the
  hosted-runner substitutions that must not be mistaken for full local release
  validation.
- Locked persistent VM asset-pin drift into the service route contract so
  profile or asset-channel updates cannot make an existing VM appear resumable
  with different boot assets.
- Exposed installed, latest, and blocked profile catalog freshness through the
  update status API so CLI, tray, UI, and TUI consumers can report profile
  updates without inspecting raw profile files.
- Changed `capsem update --assets` to refresh remote channel manifests from
  manifest provenance before downloading VM assets, so compatible asset
  releases can move independently of installed binaries.
- Changed the remote release-readiness checker to verify live
  `release.capsem.org` cache headers for mutable channel pointers and immutable
  asset/profile release artifacts.
- Changed the release-channel deploy smoke to verify public cache headers after
  Cloudflare publishes the generated site.

### Fixed
- Fixed developer setup docs and skills to call out `cdxgen` as a
  release-only prerequisite for local release workflow preflight.
- Fixed the release-channel deploy preflight to require generated Cloudflare
  cache headers before publishing `release.capsem.org`.
- Fixed the release-channel deploy preflight to require both the human index
  page and machine health JSON before publishing `release.capsem.org`.
- Fixed the remote release-readiness checker to report missing Python
  dependencies with an actionable `uv run` setup hint instead of a traceback.
- Fixed background release-channel refreshes so they honor the
  `app.auto_update` setting instead of checking daily after users disable
  automatic update checks.
- Fixed the Settings/About release-channel surface so blocked profile or asset
  tracks render as blocked instead of current.

## [1.3.1782582155] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Retried release app cargo-tool installs one tool at a time so transient
  crates.io DNS failures do not abort macOS/Linux packaging.

## [1.3.1782579305] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Installed and exported the musl C linker in release asset jobs so guest
  binaries with C/ASM dependencies cross-compile during rootfs builds.

## [1.3.1782578203] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Deferred full asset manifest generation for kernel-only image builds so
  release CI can build kernel and rootfs in sequence.

## [1.3.1782577071] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Skipped the KVM platform check only for release asset build prerequisite
  doctor runs, keeping full doctor strict for booting gates.

## [1.3.1782576216] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Installed pnpm in release asset build jobs before the shared frontend install
  rail used by `just build-kernel`.

## [1.3.1782575359] - 2026-06-27

## [1.3.1782571508] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Added a logger DB correctness test proving the same HTTP/security/model/tool
  and body-blob query results match before flush, after flush, and after
  restart rehydration.
- Added an adversarial logger DB flush test proving interrupted disk flushes
  leave memory truth coherent, disk state transactionally valid, and recovery
  flushes exact.
- Added public session-telemetry documentation for the `turn_id` /
  `model_call_id` / `tool_call_id` identity graph and mirrored the same
  debugging contract in the session DB developer skill.
- Added a public `DbHandle::write` contract test proving security ledger
  events persist exact rule/action/detection/trace/turn/credential fields.
- Added a public `DbHandle::query` contract test proving bind parameters,
  deterministic column/row JSON, and the DB-owned route output cap.
- Added a logger DB startup rehydration contract test proving existing disk
  rows are visible through `query()` before `ready()` can be trusted by routes.
- Added explicit logger DB contract tests with failure messages that point back
  to the DB boundary rationale when ready/query/write exactness regresses.
- Added public `capsem-logger` DB handle contract docs and type aliases that
  pin caller-owned query intent, DB-owned execution/storage, and loud
  missing-schema failures.
- Added the logger-owned async DB handle contract with `ready`, `query`, and
  `write` execution APIs plus structured operation/duration logging for
  session ledger reads and writes.
- Added service route DB-boundary structured logging and rewired stats,
  history, timeline, security, detection, plugin, credential, and triage ledger
  reads through `DbHandle::ready/query` instead of route-owned SQLite readers.
- Added service-owned session DB handle registration so session routes resolve
  persistent `DbHandle`s from runtime state instead of reopening ledger handles
  on every request.
- Added startup session DB handle hydration plus structured readiness logging
  and `/vms/{id}/info` DB readiness status for session ledgers.
- Added the unified tool-call ledger contract: MCP `tools/call` observations
  now write to `tool_calls origin = 'mcp'` with request/response payloads,
  protocol-only MCP messages remain in `mcp_calls`, old SQLite constraints are
  migrated to allow orphan/direct tool evidence, and the UI/Inspector/Ironbank
  contracts read user-facing tools from the single `tool_calls` table.
- Added a frontend vocabulary guard that scans product source for retired 1.3
  UI/API strings such as VM dashboard wording, policy labels, preview fields,
  raw credential hashes, and 404/501 placeholders.
- Added a release evidence collector that writes a timestamped 1.3 audit bundle
  with git, manifest, benchmark, file-inventory, and pending manual-gate facts.
- Added provider-specific Ironbank release gate entrypoints for OpenAI, AGY,
  Gemini, and Claude so the Sprinty 1.3 provider matrix runs the named
  hermetic replay tests directly instead of relying on consolidated test files.
- Added a release evidence guard that parses Ironbank tests and fails the
  bundle if release-proof tests use disabled-test markers such as `skip`,
  `skipif`, `slow`, optional markers, or `pytest.skip()`.
- Added a release evidence guard that scans installed Capsem helper binaries
  when present and fails if any active `~/.capsem/bin/capsem*` executable still
  carries retired native Keychain credential-store markers.
- Added a dedicated optional live-provider compatibility canary suite for
  OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude outside Ironbank; it reuses the model-client
  ledger assertions when operator credentials are present and stays inert when
  no live keys are configured.
- Added an Ironbank guard that keeps Anthropic/Claude replay fixtures on the
  release-target `claude-sonnet-4-6` model across mock-server responses and SDK
  ledger assertions.
- Added an Ironbank guard that keeps the hermetic Gemini replay path on the
  release-target `gemini-3.5-flash` model across script generation, mock-server
  routing, pricing, and ledger assertions.
- Added strict capsem-doctor Ironbank acceptance checks for functional package
  manager proof, hermetic doctor fixtures, and no retired escape markers in the
  installed diagnostic suite.
- Added a remote HTTPS apt Ironbank package-manager gate that installs and
  runs a Debian package through Capsem, then verifies process, file, HTTP, DNS,
  and security ledger rows.
- Added bootstrap and Justfile contract tests that prove release gates keep
  checking project skills, site structure, profile-owned asset materialization,
  ruff/ty/skill validation, and retired escape-path names.
- Added the explicit `just test-frontend` release gate so Sprinty, docs, and
  local checks all use the same frontend check/test/build path.
- Hardened macOS and Linux postinstall scripts so missing packaged helper
  binaries fail installation instead of leaving stale tools in `~/.capsem/bin`.
- Added a dedicated Ironbank Claude CLI ledger gate that runs `ollama launch claude` through the VM profile and proves the model, tool, file, credential, and security ledger path.
- Added a dedicated Ironbank Codex CLI ledger gate that runs direct Codex and
  `ollama launch codex` through the VM profile and proves the model, tool,
  file, credential, and security ledger path.
- Added fresh 1.3 release benchmark artifacts and docs for the VM-path
  mock-server protocol, lifecycle, fork, disk, and EROFS/LZ4HC performance
  gates.
- Refreshed the 1.3 release benchmark baselines from the green full
  non-manual release gate.
- Refreshed the 1.3 release benchmark baselines again after the install/profile
  asset rail fix so release evidence matches the current branch state.
- Added benchmark report output for sample counts, error rates, and a generated
  1.3 release latency/throughput graph.
- Added an Ironbank mock-server contract proving the single reusable local
  mock server serves the HTTP, HTTPS/SSE, DNS, OAuth, MCP, OpenAI, Anthropic,
  Gemini/AGY, and Ollama fixture surfaces used by release gates.
- Added a stable Ironbank capsem-doctor acceptance contract that ties the
  named release gate to the full VM doctor ledger proof and shared mock server.
- Added an Ironbank profile asset readiness gate proving profile cards can be
  built from route-owned asset status for `code` and `co-work`, including
  missing, ensure/download, shared cache reuse, hash-named assets, and manifest
  provenance.

### Fixed (service control)
- Fixed DNS load latency by replacing per-query guest vsock connect/close
  with a persistent worker pool and matching host-side framed DNS sessions,
  while keeping every DNS query on the single security/logging rail before
  the response is returned.
- Fixed logger DB read latency by reusing the DB-owned reader connection,
  moving read-query timeouts to SQLite's progress handler, and caching DB
  readiness after validation; the Ironbank route gate now measures `/stats`
  at about 0.8ms p95 through the service and about 1.1ms p95 through the
  gateway.
- Fixed stats-detail session routes so a missing or broken session ledger fails
  loudly through the logger DB handle instead of fabricating empty model, tool,
  HTTP, DNS, file, process, credential, and security data.
- Fixed logger DB readiness so session ledgers validate required route-critical
  tables/columns and fail loudly on broken schemas instead of accepting any
  open reader, including preserving `tool_calls.turn_id` through legacy table
  rebuild migrations.
- Fixed session DB handle registration so malformed existing session ledgers
  surface explicit `/vms/{id}/info` readiness errors with structured
  `vm_id`/`db_path`/operation/duration/error logging instead of degrading into
  fake empty route data.
- Removed service-owned telemetry projections from stats, timeline, triage,
  security, detection, and history routes. Logged-data routes now read through
  the logger DB boundary, and a source guard rejects raw service DB opens or
  route-owned logged-data projection state.
- Fixed the gateway route table so the Stats view can reach
  `/vms/{id}/stats/detail` through the installed app instead of receiving a
  404, and added a route-health gate that exercises the stats-detail contract
  through both service and gateway.
- Fixed profile shell bootstrap so fresh VMs keep `/opt/ai-clis/bin` on PATH
  ahead of durable `/usr/local/bin` and `/root/.local/bin`, restoring
  out-of-the-box Gemini, Codex, and global npm package-manager diagnostics.
- Fixed service startup projection hydration so incomplete or stale per-session
  ledgers degrade to empty live counters instead of preventing the service from
  accepting routes; snapshot routes remain file-backed and ignore session DB
  activity.
- Tightened the Ironbank route-health gate so profile enforcement and detection
  evaluate routes are benchmarked for latency and CPU along with status/list
  routes, preventing decision-path regressions from hiding outside hot-route
  tests.
- Fixed exec-route latency by moving session-ledger projection refreshes off
  the async route worker and returning command results without waiting for a
  full SQLite projection rebuild; serial provision-to-exec gates now pass at
  about 1s, including the three-live-VM gate.
- Fixed live MCP tool-call security projection so `capsem_mcp_call` emits
  through the existing security DB writer and mirrors the exact
  `security_rule_events` rows into service memory for `/security/latest` and
  `/security/status`, without route-time SQLite reads or a second writer.
- Fixed the session stats Tools tab to count all model-origin tool calls
  (`native`, `builtin`, and `local`) separately from protocol-origin tool
  transport (`mcp`/`mcp_proxy`) instead of presenting an MCP-only activity
  metric.
- Removed retired `capsem-mcp` lifecycle semantics: the host MCP server no
  longer registers `capsem_persist`, no longer sends create-time lifecycle
  flags, and its tool descriptions now reflect profile-owned sessions.
- Fixed the frontend VM provision contract so profile-owned CPU/RAM defaults
  stay service-owned when creating sessions from the dashboard or quick-create
  paths.
- Fixed stats detail drawers so nested event objects are compacted before
  rendering, keeping file/security rows focused on present ledger facts instead
  of showing null-only branches.
- Fixed HTTP/model body recording so compact preview fields stay separate from
  full bounded `event_body_blobs` storage while still using the single
  `DbWriter` security-event/session ledger.
- Fixed the Stats UI ledger path so HTTP, DNS, model, tool, file, process,
  credential, and body-detail rows come from a typed per-session route
  projection instead of sending raw SQL through `/vms/{id}/inspect`.
- Removed the frontend SQL Inspector surface so session UI tabs can only use
  typed route projections instead of arbitrary session database queries.
- Removed the service, gateway, and MCP raw SQL inspection surface so product
  callers cannot route arbitrary session database reads through Capsem.
- Fixed the per-session timeline route so it filters the service's in-memory
  timeline projection instead of opening `session.db` on the request path.
- Fixed the triage route so session-scoped diagnostics are served from a
  route-owned memory projection instead of querying `session.db` per request.
- Fixed the one-shot `/run` route so it stops the session without reopening
  `session.db` to synthesize counters on the request path.
- Tightened the route-authored rule ledger regression so latest security and
  detection routes are asserted against an already-hydrated projection after
  `session.db` has been moved away.
- Fixed Ironbank plugin ledger assertions so hot plugin-list routes stay
  config-only while per-plugin detail routes prove runtime execution counters.
- Fixed profile shell bootstrap payloads so shipped profiles put
  `/root/.local/bin` ahead of `/usr/local/bin`, keeping Claude/Codex/AGY
  user-local CLI installs on the path used by interactive shells and doctor
  checks.
- Fixed the dashboard session list so it refreshes explicitly, keeps long
  session lists scrollable, groups broken sessions below healthy sessions, and
  exposes a route-backed purge action instead of leaving stale broken rows mixed
  into the main list.
- Fixed TUI and tray session creation so default new-session actions route
  through profile-scoped service naming (`code-1`, `co-work-1`, etc.) instead
  of legacy `tmp-*` session creation, while preserving explicit custom names.
- Fixed the tray menu so a stopped service status cannot expose dashboard,
  session list, new-session, or connect actions that would route into dead
  service state.
- Fixed the stats Tools panel so model-native tool calls from active minimal
  `tool_calls` ledgers render from the unified tool table instead of appearing
  empty in AGY/Claude sessions that already recorded the tool rows.
- Fixed TUI terminal responsiveness under bursty keyboard/paste input by
  bounding per-tick input draining and coalescing adjacent terminal bytes before
  websocket sends, matching the browser terminal's coalescing rail.
- Fixed gateway terminal input relay latency by forwarding client keystrokes to
  the VM immediately while preserving coalesced VM-output rendering.
- Fixed Codex sandbox prerequisites in shipped profiles by adding Bubblewrap
  to profile-owned apt packages and capsem-doctor checks, preventing Codex from
  falling back to bundled sandbox helpers because `bwrap` is missing.
- Fixed runtime `/root/.local/bin` shims for curl-installed AI CLIs so
  Claude/AGY doctor checks see the same user-local command path that survives
  the writable `/root` mount.
- Fixed runtime apt HTTPS installs by keeping `/etc` traversable for apt's
  `_apt` sandbox after profile-root projection, and added a capsem-doctor gate
  that fetches and runs a real remote Debian package.
- Fixed default Codex profile seeds so shipped profiles no longer force a
  hidden local Ollama provider or startup update checks, and added release
  doctor/profile-payload guards to keep that drift from returning.
- Fixed shipped AGY/Gemini profile root seeds and image-workspace
  materialization so production profiles cannot silently force local Ollama or
  mock-provider endpoints.
- Fixed tool-call ledger contract tests so tool responses must reference both
  their matching tool-call ID in the same trace and the exact model exchange
  row that consumed the tool response.
- Fixed file-event credential attribution so ordinary model-created files keep
  their trace correlation without inheriting unrelated HTTP/OAuth credential
  references from the same agent turn.
- Fixed the session stats detail drawer so body ledger metadata is separated
  from event fields, long hashes wrap cleanly, and security snapshots render
  compact non-null JSON instead of dense null-heavy projections.
- Fixed the profile plugin list hot path so UI/TUI polling reads cached plugin
  configuration instead of scanning session databases for runtime counters;
  per-plugin detail routes still hydrate live ledger counters.
- Fixed the DNS security ledger unit test so it drains the async DB writer
  before reading joined DNS/security-rule rows, avoiding Linux coverage timing
  flakes without weakening the ledger assertion.
- Fixed Linux CI coverage so the KVM/unit lane has bounded timeout guards
  instead of hanging indefinitely without a named test failure.
- Fixed Linux release-test regressions in the KVM pause/stop harness and PTY
  bridge concurrency proof so CI verifies the intended lifecycle and full-duplex
  contracts without racy or unbounded test behavior.
- Fixed terminal WebSocket burst preservation, deterministic Linux PTY bridge
  multi-chunk transfer coverage, and macOS CI coverage upload prerequisites so
  the release gate no longer depends on runner scheduling, excessive
  coverage-load socket traffic, or missing checksum tools.
- Fixed the IPC schema-mismatch handshake regression test so it keeps the
  responder socket alive until the initiator observes the typed mismatch under
  the macOS nextest runner.
- Fixed the CI install-test asset preparation rail so placeholder initrds are
  valid gzip-compressed cpio images and the macOS bootstrap asset hash suite
  installs `b3sum` before verifying `B3SUMS`.
- Fixed the macOS CI Python coverage gate so it no longer references the
  deleted `tests/test_mcp.py` file and includes the existing image-build
  backend test needed to keep the builder coverage threshold meaningful.
- Fixed runtime profile materialization on CI hosts whose CPU architecture is
  not present in the checked-in asset manifest by falling back to the
  manifest's sole available architecture while keeping explicit `CAPSEM_ARCH`
  overrides strict.
- Fixed stale frontend development guidance that still described the gateway as
  a transparent fallback proxy instead of the explicit route allowlist used by
  the 1.3 UI/TUI contract.
- Fixed package and simulated installs to ad-hoc sign helper binaries with
  stable `org.capsem.*` identifiers, preventing rebuilds from producing
  hash-derived macOS code identities that can trigger repeated authorization
  prompts.
- Fixed the dev service/install asset rail so local service starts materialize
  a real installed-style assets directory and profile catalog instead of
  symlinking `~/.capsem/assets` to the worktree, preventing stale profile pins
  from mixing with fresh assets in the UI.
- Removed the retired global `/vms/list` asset-health payload so service and
  gateway status cannot report flat `vmlinuz/initrd/rootfs` readiness that
  contradicts profile-owned asset status.
- Removed the retired top-level gateway `/status.assets` payload and added an
  Ironbank route guard so profile asset readiness can only come from
  profile-owned asset routes.
- Removed the retired service `ListResponse.asset_health` compatibility field
  so `/vms/list` can only report sessions, never stale global VM asset health.
- Fixed profile launcher cards so missing-asset and ready states expose one
  route-owned action row instead of duplicating `Download`/`Start` in the card
  header and footer.
- Fixed package, Debian, and simulated installs so retired per-user config
  artifacts are removed before the service starts, keeping profile/corp/config
  ownership on the 1.3 rails.
- Fixed package, Debian, and simulated installs so the retired
  `capsem-admin-python` bundle is removed from `~/.capsem/bin`, preventing old
  1.2 builder/keychain code from lingering in installed trees.
- Fixed `capsem shell` input handling so bursty keypresses and paste input are
  drained in one TUI cycle instead of being throttled to one event per 16ms
  redraw tick.
- Strengthened gateway terminal relay coverage so text and binary bursts keep
  their coalesced frame contract across size limits and frame-type changes.
- Fixed the gateway architecture docs and developer skills to state the
  explicit-route/404 contract instead of describing a generic gateway
  forwarding path.
- Clarified the 1.3 manual bug hotlist against the Sprinty release ledger so
  closed work such as body blobs, MCP proof, overlay panic handling, and
  session naming/action fixes are not accidentally reopened during final smoke.
- Gitignored `.env.local` and `.env.ironbank` so live-provider canary
  credentials stay out of source control alongside the default `.env`.
- Fixed gateway startup so an explicit `--run-dir` controls the log, token,
  port, pid, and lock artifacts even when `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR` is set, restoring
  isolated Ironbank gateway logging under parallel release tests.
- Fixed isolated `just test` and `just smoke` cleanup so any test-home
  service started through the release gate is stopped by pidfile on exit,
  preventing failed or interrupted runs from leaving hidden source daemons.
- Fixed the unknown model-endpoint integration gate so it asserts provider
  identity and wire protocol separately: undeclared OpenAI-shaped traffic stays
  provider `unknown` while still recording protocol `openai`.
- Disabled the macOS Keychain-backed credential broker store for 1.3 and
  routed durable credential storage through the same file-backed store used on
  Linux, preventing repeated native credential prompts during normal service and
  TUI use.
- Removed the last runtime credential-store vault namespace vestige so 1.3
  exposes only the file-backed durable credential store, with no Keychain-shaped
  `org.capsem.credentials` runtime contract left behind.
- Fixed the macOS LaunchAgent install contract so installed services explicitly
  pin `CAPSEM_CREDENTIAL_STORE_PATH` to the file-backed credential store.
- Fixed macOS package preinstall so it no longer invokes the previously
  installed `capsem stop` binary, preventing stale Keychain-backed installs from
  prompting before the file-backed 1.3 payload replaces them.
- Fixed macOS package preinstall so it removes stale per-user
  `~/Applications/Capsem.app` bundles, preventing old GUI builds from surviving
  alongside the package-owned `/Applications/Capsem.app`.
- Strengthened the installer and release-doctor credential-store guards so the
  retired Keychain/test-store selector cannot be regenerated by package
  metadata.
- Fixed macOS package and simulated install cleanup so stale
  `~/.capsem/bin.backup*` helpers carrying retired Keychain credential-store
  code are removed and fail the release evidence guard if they reappear.
- Fixed macOS package assembly so companion binaries are rejected before
  packaging if they still carry retired native Keychain credential-store
  markers, preventing stale payloads from reintroducing credential prompts.
- Removed the desktop app's hidden native updater check and switched
  Capsem-owned HTTP clients to webpki roots so startup/status paths do not
  touch macOS platform trust or Keychain APIs outside the service contract.
- Fixed the release docs gate by restoring `just docs` as the single command
  that builds both the docs site and the marketing site.
- Fixed release telemetry docs and developer skills to identify
  `event_body_blobs` as the forensic HTTP/model/MCP body source, with preview
  fields documented only as compact UI display fields.
- Fixed the CLI service-boundary regression guard so its test-only helper no
  longer trips release clippy as dead production code.
- Added a CLI boundary guard proving `capsem stop` and the other service-control
  commands are handled before UDS/service API construction, so they cannot
  depend on profile, status, or credential-store readiness.
- Stabilized credential broker telemetry-hook tests under the full coverage
  gate by waiting for DB-visible ledger rows instead of relying on a
  one-second sleep window.
- Fixed session trace detail reads for older ledgers whose `tool_responses`
  table predates `credential_ref`, preserving tool response inspection instead
  of failing the release fixture gate.
- Fixed the Gemini/AGY stream parser so function-call argument JSON is parsed
  from raw response bytes instead of a normalized serde value, preserving the
  exact tool-call payload that enters the ledger.
- Fixed unknown-endpoint model sniffing so OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini model names
  infer the provider from the bounded request body while generic compatible
  traffic remains `unknown`.
- Updated the frontend Astro/Svelte integration dependencies to patched
  Astro/Vite versions so the release `pnpm audit` gate is clean during
  `just test`.
- Fixed bootstrap's Colima readiness check so `colima is not running` no longer
  matches the word `running` and skips the Docker VM startup path during
  `just test`.
- Fixed the generated settings/schema rail so it reads the current
  `config/docker/image` authority instead of the removed `guest/config` tree,
  keeping `just test` and CI on the same profile-derived build inputs.
- Fixed CLI status/debug health checks so they use the same `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR`
  socket and gateway files as the service client, preventing source and
  installed runs from checking different Capsem runtimes.
- Fixed the service file API control-channel contract so 1 MiB file
  read/write round trips no longer tear down the guest agent stream, and
  restored the initrd repack path to build guest agents from
  `config/docker/image` instead of the removed `guest/config` tree.
- Fixed `capsem stop` and other service-control commands so they stay pure
  local control operations and no longer start the background update/network
  refresh before dispatch.
- Fixed explicit service stops so installed clients remember the user stopped
  Capsem and refuse to auto-launch the service from status/session requests
  until `capsem start` is run, preventing surprise credential-store hydration
  and Keychain prompts during stop flows.

### Fixed (terminal throughput)
- Coalesced desktop terminal output to one xterm write per animation frame and
  batched bursty terminal input before WebSocket send, preventing high-volume
  agent output from starving keyboard responsiveness.
- Coalesced gateway terminal relay bursts in both directions, so adjacent
  terminal WebSocket/UDS frames are batched without losing byte order while
  preserving a short interactive flush deadline.

### Fixed (session lifecycle)
- Fixed MCP snapshot reverts that reported `action: deleted` through the tool
  result while leaving the created file visible inside the guest workspace.
- Fixed stale persistent sessions whose preserved boot logs show overlayfs
  `Stale file handle` / kernel panic failures so they are reconciled as
  `Defunct`, cannot be resumed, keep the original boot-failure reason in
  route JSON, and are removed by default purge.
- Fixed session ledger inspection for incompatible persistent sessions so
  stats, timeline, and forensic views can still read the preserved
  `session.db` while the session remains non-resumable and delete-only.
- Replaced ad hoc temporary session names with profile-scoped session names
  such as `code-1` and `co-work-1` across service provisioning, the TUI create
  dialog, and the desktop UI, while preserving focus handoff to newly created
  sessions.

### Changed (route surfaces and diagnostics)
- Rewired `/stats` to read the main session ledger through the logger
  `DbHandle::ready/query` path with structured query/error logging, and added
  a guard against route-time `SessionIndex::open` regressions.
- Changed logger DB writes to acknowledge after the DB-owned memory commit,
  then batch-flush dirty memory tables to disk on threshold, interval,
  explicit flush, and shutdown without exposing dirty-set mechanics to routes.
- Clarified the shared agent, testing, debugging, architecture, and Rust
  guidance for the logger DB boundary: routes may own query intent, but only
  the logger DB object owns SQLite execution, connection threads, mem/disk
  layout, batching, flush, rehydration, and schema failures.
- Clarified the release architecture and developer skills so the documented
  service routes use the explicit `/vms/...` contract, VM asset manifests use
  BLAKE3/origin reporting instead of local minisign theater, and `tool_calls`
  is named as the canonical tool ledger while `mcp_calls` is transport
  evidence.
- Added a release compliance gate for SBOM, OBOM, and build-ledger evidence,
  clarifying that OBOMs describe base VM images while build ledgers remain
  debug evidence.
- Renamed the private mock-server implementation and benchmark artifact
  directory so release tests and docs refer to the single reusable
  mock-server/protocol rail instead of retired MITM-local wording.
- Exposed model request/response/tool-call validity facts in serialized
  security events so route JSON matches the first-party CEL model facts used
  by enforcement.
- Added a config-layout gate that makes the settings/corp/profiles/docker/data
  source contract executable and rejects host metadata or generated pins in
  checked-in profile config.
- Moved image build defaults out of checked-in `guest` source config and into
  `config/docker/image`, with `capsem-admin` generating the backend image
  workspace from the selected profile plus Docker image defaults.
- Added an Ironbank Gemini API ledger gate proving public Gemini
  `streamGenerateContent` and `generateContent` traffic through the hermetic
  mock server records Google provider/protocol rows, tool calls, non-stream
  output, brokered credentials, DNS/HTTP evidence, and security decisions.
- Fixed installed asset cleanup so `manifest-origin.json` survives service
  startup, preserving manifest origin/hash reporting while profile asset
  readiness and `capsem update --assets` hydrate through the hash-named asset
  rail.
- Tightened the TUI session contract so profile launch options come only from
  `/profiles/list`, no fallback profile is synthesized from stale session
  rows, and user-facing TUI controls say sessions rather than VMs.
- Removed retired frontend policy vocabulary from settings origins and dead
  network-policy IPC types so profile UI surfaces speak enforcement,
  detection, plugins, MCP, and assets directly.
- Removed the visible frontend build timestamp from the main toolbar; build and
  version evidence remain available through debug/status surfaces.
- Replaced raw toolbar status colors with semantic UI tokens so service chrome
  follows the Capsem design contract.
- Added frontend route-contract gates for the Sessions dashboard and profile
  surfaces so the UI must keep using route-owned profile/session terminology,
  asset readiness, enforcement, detection, plugins, MCP, and canonical detail
  payloads.
- Removed the retired MCP tool `approved` field from profile MCP route
  responses; the UI/TUI contract now exposes only route-backed
  `permission_action` / `permission_source` decisions.
- Cleaned the desktop stats/detail panes so HTTP/model bodies are loaded from
  the blob ledger rather than preview columns, credential broker rows display
  verbs/origins instead of substitution refs, and inspector presets use the
  same broker vocabulary as the session UI.
- Tightened the desktop stats contract so user-facing detail controls say
  session ledger instead of database, and MCP protocol cards no longer surface
  credential-reference counts that belong to the credential broker view.
- Added a service and gateway route-matrix gate for profile UI surfaces so
  `code` and `co-work` profile pages must expose assets, enforcement,
  detection, plugins, credential broker, and MCP routes without 404/501
  fallbacks.
- Fixed gateway forwarding for session snapshot status/list routes and added
  route-contract coverage so the stats UI reads snapshot state through the
  explicit service route instead of hitting a gateway 404.
- Added service-level plugin route contract coverage so profile plugin list,
  info, edit, credential-broker detail, retry, and unknown-plugin responses
  prove the typed pre/post/logging stage surface through UDS.
- Fixed profile plugin edits so `/profiles/{profile_id}/plugins/{plugin_id}/edit`
  persists to the profile file, refreshes route-visible policy immediately, and
  records a `profile_mutation_events` ledger row instead of using a runtime-only
  override.
- Added credential store lifecycle route coverage proving startup hydration,
  explicit broker retry, memory-only hot reads, empty-versus-ready status, and
  raw-secret absence from service/plugin route JSON.
- Tightened the profile plugin UI contract so plugin rows render route-owned
  stage, version, mode, detection level, counters, latency, and broker
  capabilities, while credential inventory uses provider/last-seen/counts
  instead of exposing raw BLAKE references as the primary identity.
- Added service-side snapshot and DbWriter contract coverage proving snapshot
  status/list routes are file/IPC-backed, ignore toxic `session.db` rows, and
  keep per-session SQLite writes on the capsem-process `DbWriter` rail.
- Added a session dashboard route gate proving defunct and incompatible
  sessions remain delete-only across list/status/info/resume/delete routes,
  and cleaned frontend session wording checks so stale VM labels cannot hide in
  test noise.
- Cached profile route summaries in service memory so `/profiles/list` no
  longer reloads profile files or recompiles rule sets on every UI/TUI poll;
  the Ironbank route-health gate now shows profile list p95 in single-digit
  milliseconds with negligible service CPU.
- Renamed the local protocol benchmark internals from the retired
  `mitm-local` escape-hatch wording to the shared mock-server protocol rail;
  `capsem-bench protocol` remains the public command and now emits
  `mock_server_protocol` benchmark JSON.
- Fixed profile route summaries so `code` and `co-work` expose route-owned
  rule, plugin, MCP, and asset metadata without leaking host profile paths or
  falling back to default-only profile assumptions.
- Refreshed the 1.3 benchmark artifacts and docs from the canonical
  `just bench` rail, including mock-server HTTP/protocol throughput plus
  lifecycle and fork timings used by the S05 route-latency gate.
- Hardened the Ironbank HTTP body ledger proof so upstream transcript
  assertions ignore non-HTTP records instead of failing on unrelated DNS
  rows emitted by the hermetic mock server.
- Added strict model wire-protocol recording to the session ledger so model
  traffic can preserve both the endpoint owner (`provider`) and the recognized
  protocol (`protocol`) without collapsing OpenAI-compatible local traffic into
  a fake provider.
- Changed `just bench` to use the artifact-recording release benchmark path
  with the shared local mock server, so HTTP, proxy throughput, and protocol
  benchmarks fail on skips and publish local numbers alongside lifecycle/fork
  artifacts.
- Fixed security decision ledgers so visible default catchall rules remain
  recorded in `security_rule_events` without emitting a second effective
  decision after a more specific profile/corp enforcement rule wins. The code
  and co-work profiles now include an explicit hermetic mock-server allow rule
  for `127.0.0.1:3713`, so doctor, benchmark, and Ironbank traffic does not
  trip the default local-network ask rule.
- Tightened the CEL fact contract exposed by profile enforcement routes:
  evaluate requests now materialize typed `http`, `dns`, `mcp`, `model`,
  `file`, `process`, `ip`, `tcp`, and `udp` facts, default rules include
  unknown-model and unknown-MCP detections, and provider endpoint aliases are
  rejected in favor of explicit `allowed_remote_targets`.
- Fixed Ironbank route contracts for MCP tools and file listings so profile
  MCP routes assert the current permission-action shape and `.txt` uploads are
  reported deterministically as text/plain instead of Magika-dependent
  octet-stream.
- Strengthened `/vms/create` and `/vms/{id}/resume` responses so provision
  routes return the session profile ID, lifecycle state, persistence bit,
  resumability, and valid action enum list alongside the VM ID and UDS path.
  Ironbank route-health now proves create/status/info/list/exec/fork/pause/
  resume/stop/delete/purge state and latency budgets through service and
  gateway routes.
- Strengthened the Ironbank route-health gate so profile enforcement evaluate
  routes must prove exact `allow`, `ask`, and `block` decisions, detection
  rows, and plugin execution stages while keeping hot control-route CPU and
  latency budgets under test.
- Added a first-class `event_body_blobs` ledger for HTTP, model, and MCP
  request/response bodies with a 10 MiB bounded capture, original/stored byte
  counts, BLAKE3 body hash, content type, trace ID, and truncation flag. Stats
  details now load `request_body`/`response_body` from that ledger instead of
  treating preview fields as forensic truth.
- Strengthened the Claude/Anthropic Ironbank ledger proof to cover
  non-streaming HTTP, streaming SSE, and SDK client paths through the same
  model/tool/file/security/broker ledger assertions. Repeated same-path model
  checks now anchor tool rows and tool responses to the current model-call IDs
  and trace IDs so provider proofs cannot pass on stale rows.
- Extended the OpenAI/Codex Ironbank ledger proof to cover Responses,
  embeddings, and image-generation traffic through the same VM/session DB
  path. OpenAI image endpoints are now classified as model traffic and their
  generated payloads are recorded in `model_calls.text_content` while brokered
  credentials remain opaque and raw secrets stay out of DB/log output.
- Strengthened the Codex CLI Ironbank proof so tool-call IDs are derived from
  the per-run nonce and local OpenAI-compatible traffic asserts
  `provider = unknown`, `protocol = openai`, and the unknown-provider
  detection rule instead of relying on stale fixed identifiers.
- Added a host `capsem-mcp` Ironbank proof that exercises the real stdio MCP
  server against `capsem-service`, verifies every advertised tool, calls the
  session/file/exec/MCP/log/triage routes with deterministic inputs, and
  reconciles MCP, file, exec, security, route, snapshot, and structured-log
  ledger output. Host-triggered exec events now carry trace IDs so MCP-driven
  command activity stays attributable through the session ledger.
- Added a reusable Ironbank two-turn model ledger assertion surface that
  computes expected trace/cardinality from externally meaningful client facts
  and proves exactly matched model item, tool call, tool response, file, DNS,
  HTTP, security, credential, and upstream transcript rows through a dedicated
  black-box VM test.
- Removed the remaining network-side HTTP port denial from the MITM path so
  routing/capture mechanics no longer issue security verdicts outside the CEL
  security-event rail. The former `NetworkPolicy` type is now named
  `NetworkMechanics`, and Ironbank now guards old policy-v2, MCP decision,
  fallback logger, side-write, and retired policy authoring strings from
  reappearing in live code.
- Added dedicated Ironbank credential broker and plugin ledger proof. Broker
  coverage now has its own release-gate entry point for capture, brokered
  rewrite, injection rows, and raw-secret absence, while plugin route coverage
  proves profile-scoped list/info/edit, broker inventory/reload, dummy
  pre/post mode changes, serialized security-event detections, plugin
  executions, and evaluation decisions.
- Removed the old settings-tree MCP server rail. Settings metadata and
  settings responses now expose UI/application preferences only, while MCP
  remains profile-owned through `/profiles/{profile_id}/mcp/...` routes.
  Default security-rule catchalls also remain visible in the security ledger
  after specific rules match, so forensic rows show both the specific verdict
  and the late default rule.
- Removed the dead MCP server merge rail that auto-detected host AI CLI MCP
  configs and merged manual/corp/user inputs outside the profile contract.
  Runtime MCP server construction is now guarded to use profile-owned
  `build_profile_server_list()` only, with docs and skills updated to remove
  the stale fallback language.
- Renamed the MCP configuration contract from `McpUserConfig` to
  `McpProfileConfig` and added a no-legacy guard so profile/corp-owned MCP
  config cannot regress to user-config terminology.
- Hardened profile parsing so `assets` is a required profile-owned section
  instead of silently defaulting to the first built-in profile's asset release.
  Profile contract and admin profile-check tests now prove malformed profiles
  cannot inherit Code assets by omission.
- Aligned the shared settings conformance fixture with the 1.3 contract that
  settings are UI/application preferences only. Python, Rust, and frontend
  settings schema tests now reject stale AI-provider, credential, profile-file,
  and `enabled_by` provider surfaces instead of requiring them.
- Split model wire protocol from endpoint-provider identity so Ollama,
  OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, and unknown model endpoints can be
  parsed without pretending protocol and provider are aliases. Recognized model
  protocol traffic on undeclared endpoints now emits `model.provider =
  "unknown"` and hits a default informational detection rule.
- Fixed local model enforcement so explicit profile/corp allow rules win over
  the built-in local-network `ask` default while the default rule remains
  visible in the security ledger. Model request/response events now carry the
  same `tcp.port`/`ip.value` transport facts as HTTP events, and Ironbank
  proves UDS and HTTP latest routes expose the same unknown-provider detection
  row.
- Tightened credential brokerage for unknown OpenAI-compatible and
  Anthropic-compatible model endpoints: `Authorization` and `x-api-key` headers
  are brokered from protocol/header shape without relabeling the provider, and
  async file attribution keeps the first credential seen for a trace.
- Fixed the AGY hermetic replay fixture so Google Code Assist
  `listExperiments` matches the recorded 68 experiment IDs and 250 flags, and
  `/log` accepts protobuf play-log telemetry with the recorded empty text/plain
  acknowledgement instead of fake JSON.
- Refactored the Ironbank model-client proof into composable script-builder
  and ledger-assertion helpers, and made the Codex CLI fixture use the same
  brokered OpenAI credential path as the SDK/API clients instead of a
  non-secret marker shortcut.
- Tightened the shared Ironbank AI-client harness so every credentialed model
  client proof must show broker capture, brokered request rewrite, one shared
  `credential_ref` across HTTP/model/tool-call/tool-response/file rows, exact
  substitution ledger verbs, and raw-secret absence from DB/log output. The
  OpenAI API, OpenAI two-turn, Codex CLI, Claude HTTP, and Claude SDK proofs
  now all run through that same broker contract.
- Tightened the OpenAI-compatible Ironbank double-turn ledger so repeated
  model history is deduplicated by persisted BLAKE3 item hashes, model tool
  calls register workspace file-path trace hints, and subsequent fs-monitor
  events plus security-rule rows are attributed to the same model trace. The
  focused proof now asserts two random tool calls produce exactly two traces,
  ten model item rows, four model calls, four HTTP rows, one DNS row, two tool
  calls, two tool responses, and two created file events.
- Tightened the HTTP Ironbank ledger path so active profiles carry corp network
  mechanics into `capsem-process`, HTTP security events expose `http.query`,
  `http.body`, `tcp.port`, and `ip.value` to CEL and forensic rows, and the
  first plain-JSON HTTP full-chain test reconciles client output, upstream
  transcript, `net_events`, `security_rule_events`, UDS inspect, gateway
  inspect, timeline, security status/latest, VM status counters, and structured
  service/gateway logs.
- Fixed blocked HTTP telemetry so CEL-denied requests now keep request byte
  counts, request previews, and client-visible denial response previews in the
  same ledger path as allowed requests, with Ironbank proof that the denied
  request never reaches the upstream fixture.
- Fixed pending HTTP `ask` decisions so clients see an approval-required 403
  instead of a generic block message, while Ironbank proves the pending
  `security_ask_events` lifecycle row, `policy_action = ask`, security status,
  UDS inspect, gateway inspect, counters, and logs all agree.
- Fixed brokered HTTP credential rewrite accounting so OAuth captures emit
  exact `captured`/`brokered`/`injected` ledger verbs, broker refs replay into
  upstream header/query bytes without leaking raw credentials to DB, routes, or
  logs, and credential inventory merges injected rows with their captured
  provider identity. Grouped CEL rule matches such as `a && (b || c)` now
  compile through the same profile rule path used by the HTTP rewrite proof.
- Changed the credential broker durable store to the same file-backed backend on
  macOS and Linux for 1.3, so service startup/reload hydrates captured
  credentials without native credential prompts.
- Tightened HTTP body-handling ledger proof for gzip, chunked, SSE, truncated
  preview, and HTTPS override traffic. Decoded gzip responses now log the same
  materialized headers and body bytes delivered to the guest instead of stale
  compressed response metadata.
- Added DNS Ironbank ledger proof for allowed and blocked UDP DNS traffic.
  Allowed DNS rows now carry the matched security rule and policy fields just
  like blocked rows, hermetic DNS upstream transcripts prove blocked
  exfiltration never leaves the VM boundary, and security status exposes
  detection-level counters regenerated from `session.db`.
- Added MCP Ironbank ledger proof for profile-owned builtin MCP and observed
  remote MCP traffic. MCP security events now carry request arguments,
  response content, trace IDs, and transport facts through CEL, DB rows, UDS
  inspection, gateway inspection, latest/status routes, and structured logs.
- Added Ironbank file/process/snapshot and package-manager ledger proofs.
  The new black-box coverage exercises file import/export/create/modify/delete
  rows, symlink escape rejection, process audit versus exec semantics,
  snapshot route hermeticity, package-manager functional probes, route
  serialization, and DB-backed security rows.
- Tightened Ironbank model/client coverage so the mock server replays an
  Ollama-compatible OpenAI chat-completion shape with native tool calls, the
  OpenAI SDK/Anthropic SDK/LiteLLM/Ollama SDK/Codex CLI paths assert full
  model, HTTP, security, file, exec, credential, and session DB ledger fields,
  and the tests now fail on any public HTTP or DNS side traffic. This caught and
  closed Codex plugin/OTLP side calls and LiteLLM's default public cost-map
  fetch during hermetic release proof.
- Added a full mock-server JSONL request ledger and upgraded the Codex CLI
  Ironbank proof to drive the OpenAI Responses API through a native
  `exec_command` tool call, require Codex to write a random UUID4 hex value to a
  random filename, return only the successful tool status to the model, and
  reconcile exact HTTP bodies with
  `model_calls`, `tool_calls`, `fs_events`, `net_events`, and
  `security_rule_events`.
- Upgraded the mock server and Ironbank launcher proof for
  `ollama launch claude`: the mock now replays Anthropic streaming `tool_use`
  and final-message SSE shapes, structurally detects real `tool_result` blocks,
  and the ledger proof covers Claude's real `Bash` tool call, tool response,
  token usage, file write, HTTP/model rows, DNS, and security rules. AI request
  capture is now bounded at 1 MiB by default so large real agent continuations
  are parseable instead of clipping away trailing tool results.
- Tightened the config authority guard so `config/` can only contain the
  declared `settings/`, `corp/`, `profiles/`, `docker/`, and `data/` roots;
  active docs and skills now explicitly reject admin/default/guest/preset/
  registry/template roots, clarify that settings have schemas while profiles
  have catalogs, and describe `capsem-admin` as a validation/materialization
  tool rather than a product authoring surface.
- Tightened the profile-derived image/config contract in docs and developer
  skills: `config/` is now documented as settings/corp/profiles/docker/data,
  `capsem-admin` is explicitly a validator/materializer/build tool rather
  than a config authority, stale `guest/config` authoring and source-profile
  pin language is removed from active documentation and skills, and `capsem-admin image
  build --dry-run` is no longer a public product rail. The internal settings UI
  metadata parser no longer calls itself a registry, preserving the rule that
  profiles and corp own runtime truth while settings only describe
  UI/application preferences; private capsem-admin scaffold helpers are now
  burned by a guard test too.
- Burned the public `capsem-builder build`, `validate`, `inspect`, `mcp`, and
  `--dry-run` rails so product image/config work can only enter through
  profile-owned config plus `capsem-admin`; docs, skills, and CLI tests now
  document and enforce `capsem-builder` as a backend helper only.
- Kept profile image builds behind the `capsem-admin image build` rail while
  moving Docker/template execution to a private Python backend module, and
  tightened partial asset generation so rootfs-only or kernel-only outputs
  cannot mint a bootable manifest or delete unrelated arch assets.
- Fixed PR CI Python coverage so the schema/builder coverage step runs the
  explicit Python contract suite that exercises `src/capsem`, instead of
  replaying VM, serial, install, MCP, service, and Ironbank suites under one
  monolithic `pytest tests/ --cov` command; the gate now also covers malformed
  dev skill frontmatter, symlink, empty-root, and bad-entry cases so remote
  runner coverage drift no longer drops the Python gate below threshold.
- Fixed PR CI non-VM Python integration setup so bootstrap, codesign, and
  rootfs artifact tests generate their ignored local test assets through
  `capsem-admin`, build the exact debug host binaries under inspection, and
  ad-hoc sign them with the canonical entitlement before asserting the package
  and signing contracts.
- Fixed PR CI frontend coverage by moving generated settings/mock fixture
  creation onto a shared `build_system/scripts/build/generate-settings.sh` rail, running that rail
  before frontend build/check in CI, declaring the Vitest coverage provider,
  uploading the actual `web/app/coverage/coverage-final.json`, and excluding
  generated coverage output from later frontend type checks.
- Fixed PR CI Rust coverage so `cargo llvm-cov` reports and uploads coverage
  without aborting the rest of the release gate on a local percentage
  threshold; Codecov remains the coverage ledger while Python, frontend,
  schema, cross-compile, and artifact checks now still run.
- Fixed the Docker install e2e package path so Linux `.deb` repacking
  materializes profile-owned runtime config before copying profiles into the
  package, using the same shared materializer as local dev recipes instead of
  assuming `just` exists inside the package-test container.
- Fixed Docker install e2e asset bootstrap so the ignored local `assets/`
  working tree is prepared with tiny test boot files and a `capsem-admin`
  generated manifest before profile materialization.
- Fixed CI regressions where macOS Rust coverage compiled the Tauri app before
  `web/app/dist` existed, and Linux ARM agent exec tests selected `/root` as
  cwd for a non-root runner user simply because the directory existed.
- Fixed ARM Linux CI compilation for KVM checkpoint tests by keeping portable
  checkpoint header decode coverage on every target while gating x86 KVM vCPU,
  IRQ, PIT, and MMIO serialization tests to x86_64 where those structs exist.
- Fixed CI release gates so Rust coverage no longer references the deleted
  `capsem-debug-upstream` crate and Python lint validates the top-level
  `skills/` library instead of the retired `config/skills` path.
- Made the credential broker memory-first behind an opaque `CredentialStore`:
  captures update runtime memory before durable storage, replay/status checks
  no longer hit Keychain or disk, real substitutions can hydrate on cache
  miss, service `/status` reports only ready/degraded state, and
  `/profiles/{id}/plugins/credential_broker/credentials/{info,reload}` exposes
  the detailed broker store object plus explicit retry.
- Routed the profile-scoped credential broker retry endpoint through the HTTP
  gateway and pinned it in the explicit route allowlist so the UI cannot see a
  404 for a service-supported profile/plugin operation.
- Added a real-service gateway contract test for the profile overview route
  bundle so profile info, credential broker status/retry, asset status,
  enforcement rules, and detection rules must all survive the HTTP gateway with
  the UI-facing JSON field shape intact.
- Extended file-boundary IPC so plugin `rewrite` decisions can return mutated
  bytes to the service for import/export/read/write boundaries; the service
  now writes or returns only the bytes approved by the plugin-aware security
  rail, while block still fails closed.
- Fixed file-boundary rewrite materialization so logging-stage sanitizers and
  large-content security previews cannot truncate or replace guest file bytes;
  data-plane rewrites now require a complete payload and an applied
  non-logging `rewrite` plugin.
- Fixed the Linux installed-package build by scoping the Keychain credential
  index type to macOS, keeping the non-macOS credential store warning-clean
  under the package e2e `-D warnings` gate.
- Tightened plugin route regression coverage so `rewrite` mode proves an
  actual event mutation and `block` mode remains the only plugin mode that
  denies the evaluated security event.
- Tightened Ironbank plugin matrix coverage so postprocess plugin detections
  must appear in the security event detection vector, closing the explicit
  allow/ask/block/disable/rewrite/pre/post/detection-level proof item.
- Removed fake confidence from broker-created credential observations and
  injections; substitution rows keep the historical nullable column, but
  broker emissions now record `NULL` confidence.
- Hardened file import/export security boundaries so explicit file writes run
  through the plugin-aware security rail, plugin `block` decisions deny the
  VM-facing file operation before bytes are written or returned, and profile
  plugin edits reload matching active VMs before returning. Ironbank now proves
  the denied EICAR import, live plugin disable, allowed import, and exact
  session DB plugin decision/execution ledger.
- Split security plugins into explicit preprocess, postprocess, and logging
  stages while preserving the single `SecurityEvent -> SecurityEvent` plugin
  contract; the credential broker now owns credential observation/storage as a
  security plugin, and the log sanitizer owns the ledger-safe projection before
  emission. The profile/corp plugin policy and route-visible plugin catalog now
  expose all three stages instead of hiding logging plugins behind a
  compatibility bucket.
- Renamed the core security plugin stage contract to
  `preprocess`/`postprocess`/`logging` and extended the security action
  benchmark matrix to cover all three plugin kinds, including the logging
  sanitizer.
- Extended credential broker replay so broker refs in HTTP headers or queries
  are treated as preprocess injection events, materialized only for upstream
  runtime bytes, and recorded in the substitution ledger as `injected` without
  leaking raw secrets or broker refs through sanitized header payloads.
- Expanded the Ironbank credential broker ledger proof to cover query replay,
  JSON request bodies, form request bodies, OAuth response token bodies, and
  generic credential response bodies through the real VM path and hermetic
  mock server.
- Added route-visible plugin execution counters and latency totals for
  security plugins, and moved MITM rule-ledger emission onto the plugin-aware
  security event path so broker and log-sanitizer executions are preserved in
  session DB forensic payloads and `/profiles/{id}/plugins/list`.
- Documented the runtime-vs-ledger materialization split across security
  policy, network isolation, MITM architecture, and developer skills so future
  work keeps credential capture/injection in the broker plugin and ledger
  materialization in logging plugins instead of network formatters, routes, DB
  readers, frontend transforms, or test harnesses.
- Hardened the local OpenAI-compatible model path: bounded request sniffing now
  promotes unknown localhost model traffic before CEL/plugin evaluation, the
  credential broker uses the parsed provider hint for SDK bearer headers, and
  Ironbank proves the VM-visible OpenAI SDK response, tool call, file write,
  broker reference, substitution ledger, route counters, raw-secret absence,
  explicit model allow rules, and the default local-network `ask` guard end to
  end.
- Removed provider-aware credential brokering from MITM header formatting so
  network helpers no longer create credential refs or credential observations.
- Replaced the Rust mock-server crate with the shared Python mock server
  runtime for doctor, integration, recorder, benchmark, and Ironbank tests, so
  there is one hermetic protocol lab and no duplicate fixture implementation.
- Extended `capsem-mock-server` with deterministic DNS fixtures over UDP and
  TCP, reported in its ready JSON, so doctor, recorder, benchmark, and
  Ironbank work can exercise DNS without public resolvers or a second fixture
  server.
- Extended `capsem-mock-server` with a real local HTTPS listener that serves
  the same deterministic fixtures as HTTP, giving doctor, recorder, benchmark,
  and Ironbank work one protocol lab for HTTP, HTTPS/MITM, DNS, SSE,
  WebSocket, MCP, OAuth, and model replay.
- Extended the protocol fixture recorder to capture and replay DNS fixtures
  from `capsem-mock-server`, keeping DNS in the same sanitized fixture corpus
  as model, MCP, OAuth, credential, and HTTP-like flows.
- Removed the env-gated local MITM benchmark skip from the serial release
  tests and restored its default load to 50,000 requests at concurrency 64, so
  `just test` always produces meaningful local HTTP/SSE/WebSocket MITM
  baseline numbers through the shared mock server.
- Hardened the in-VM network doctor so missing or unroutable
  `CAPSEM_MOCK_SERVER_BASE_URL` fails the local HTTP/SSE/WebSocket/OAuth/model
  proof instead of silently skipping deterministic protocol coverage.
- Clarified the shared skills contract for profile `build.sh`: it is a
  rootfs-only build hook, not an installer/runtime/config path, and changes
  require profile descriptor updates, asset rebuilds, and black-box VM proof.
- Routed service-initiated profile MCP tool calls through the logged MCP
  JSON-RPC security rail instead of calling the aggregator directly, so
  `capsem_mcp_call` now writes `mcp_calls`, built-in MCP HTTP `net_events`,
  and matching `mcp.tool_call` security-rule rows through the process
  `DbWriter`.
- Added an Ironbank-native profile MCP ledger proof for `capsem_mcp_call` that
  drives `capsem-mcp`, profile MCP routes, a fresh VM, the shared mock server,
  and read-only session DB checks in one black-box release gate.
- Hardened agent bootstrap packaging: profile build hooks now remove
  installer-created OAuth/token/history/cache/log residue before rootfs
  packaging, AGY runs through the Capsem sandbox wrapper by default, and Gemini
  is wrapped without copying its npm entrypoint so relative JS chunk imports
  still work. Ironbank now boots a fresh VM and proves AGY, Claude, Codex, and
  Gemini bootstrap commands plus route/session ledgers from the outside.
- Extended the Ironbank model ledger proof to drive real Anthropic, LiteLLM,
  and native Ollama Python SDK clients through the shared mock server, and
  fixed native Ollama `/api/chat` classification so session DB rows, security
  ledgers, route output, token counts, byte counts, and file writes agree.
- Extended gateway `/status` to preserve the service profile catalog and
  installed asset manifest provenance, including profile readiness, manifest
  origin/source/hash, validation status, and current asset/binary versions.
- Included installed asset manifest provenance in support bundles so debug
  reports preserve the manifest origin/source/hash trail alongside the active
  asset manifest.
- Extended support-bundle debug diagnostics with the current profile route
  inventory and profile OBOM descriptors, including `/profiles/{id}/obom`,
  BLAKE3 hash, generator metadata, size, and base-image scope.
- Added support-bundle supply-chain references for the host SPDX SBOM release
  artifact, GitHub attestation source, profile CycloneDX OBOM routes, and
  manifest provenance paths.
- Hardened package artifact tests so local and remote manifest overrides prove
  the packaged manifest payload and `manifest-origin.json` provenance instead
  of only checking installer script text.
- Added the manifest file BLAKE3 to `capsem-admin manifest check --json` and
  logged manifest report/provenance events during package postinstall.
- Tightened the Ironbank doctor ledger gate so local-network `ask` decisions,
  informational detections, serialized detection payloads, and security plugin
  execution timings are proven from session DB rows instead of only counted.
- Renamed the deterministic local fixture upstream to `capsem-mock-server` and
  made `CAPSEM_MOCK_SERVER_BASE_URL` the shared contract for doctor,
  integration, recorder, benchmark, and Ironbank-style black-box tests.
- Added an Ironbank package-manager ledger proof that boots a VM through public
  service routes, verifies apt, npm, uv, pip, and node packages perform real
  work, and audits session history plus `exec_events`/`fs_events` fields.
- Hardened VM fork cloning so `session.db` is snapshotted through SQLite
  instead of copied as a raw file. Forks of forks now preserve WAL-backed
  committed ledger rows as a standalone quick-check-clean database, preventing
  boot failures from malformed copied session DBs.
- Hardened Apple VZ suspend/resume and benchmark gates: checkpoint files now
  require an fsynced completion marker before a VM can be considered
  suspended, save/restore remain exclusive across service workers, cold starts
  stay concurrent, and timing probes run isolated after the `-n 4` integration
  canary so published boot/lifecycle numbers remain meaningful.
- Replaced fork-package proof in MCP and lifecycle benchmarks with a hermetic
  local `.deb` probe installed through the public VM file/exec routes, so fork
  preservation no longer depends on public `apt` repositories while still
  proving rootfs overlay package state survives the fork.
- Pointed the injection test runner at the materialized profile catalog and a
  short `/tmp` CAPSEM_HOME so injection scenarios exercise package/CI-style
  profile config without tripping macOS Unix-socket path limits.
- Made `doctor --fix` rebuild VM assets for every checked-in profile through a
  named profile loop instead of a default-only asset build, with a release
  contract test guarding the recipe.
- Aligned support-bundle and gateway test fixtures with the current
  profile/settings layout and VM `available_actions` contract, and cleaned up
  Rust formatting debt from the release cleanup branch.
- Hardened profile routing assumptions by passing the full release gate under
  temporary arbitrary profile ids before restoring the shipping `code` and
  `co-work` profile identities. This keeps profile-aware routes, UI/TUI
  helpers, admin materialization, and install packaging from silently depending
  on a single hardcoded profile.
- Added a real checked-in `co-work` profile as source profile data, and
  tightened Profile UI/TUI/service tests so profile-aware surfaces consume
  route-provided profile ids instead of silently falling back to `code`.
- Advanced the 1.3 release metadata to `1.3.1781205836`, pinned the frontend
  `esbuild` override through the lockfile, and archived fresh lifecycle, fork,
  in-VM storage, and parallel benchmark ledgers for the current build.
- Fixed the gateway profile MCP surface so the UI/TUI route for reading and
  editing a profile's default MCP permission forwards to the service instead
  of returning a route-level 404.
- Moved dashboard session creation controls onto each profile card: ready
  profiles expose a primary `New` action, profiles with missing assets expose
  `Download`, and `Customize` opens the session dialog preselected to that
  profile.
- Added a compact route-backed VM asset checklist to each profile launcher
  card so users can see which kernel/initrd/rootfs assets are present or
  missing before starting or downloading a profile.
- Fixed dashboard session actions so incompatible or defunct sessions remain
  non-openable and expose only the delete action even if a stale status payload
  includes start, resume, or fork actions.
- Tightened the MCP profile UI so default and per-tool permission controls use
  the same typed allow/ask/block option list as the route contract.
- Fixed credential broker stats so captured, brokered, injected, and error
  events are counted independently instead of treating every broker row as a
  captured credential.
- Made credential capture write the full durable verb trail: observed secrets
  now emit `captured` and `brokered`, while replayed references emit
  `injected`.
- Fixed the hermetic credential broker test store so concurrent captures cannot
  corrupt the store or lose refs before replay.
- Added Ironbank coverage for unknown-host OpenAI-compatible body-shape
  detection: neutral-path model traffic now proves model rows, broker refs, and
  detection-rule ledger output.
- Added Ironbank coverage for unknown remote MCP-over-HTTP JSON-RPC activity:
  observed initialize/list/tool-call traffic now proves MCP DB rows, timeline
  route evidence, and `mcp.tool_list`/`mcp.tool_call` security ledger entries.
- Added Ironbank coverage for declaration-only model tools: an
  OpenAI-compatible request may advertise tools without creating executed
  `tool_calls` rows unless the model response actually emits a tool call.
- Tightened Ironbank tool-call ledger coverage so executed model tool calls
  must have exact row counts, declaration-only tools stay absent, and observed
  MCP `tools/call` rows correlate by trace and tool name without protocol
  chatter becoming phantom executions.
- Added Ironbank coverage for Gemini/Google and Claude/Anthropic streaming
  model traffic through hermetic SSE fixtures, proving client-visible bytes,
  parsed model rows, security-ledger entries, and brokered API-key references.
- Fixed the credential broker so Google `x-goog-api-key` headers are captured
  as Google credentials even before a provider hint exists.
- Hardened profile root bootstrap packaging: `capsem-admin profile check` now
  rejects unpinned files under a profile root seed, profile payload tests prove
  AGY/Claude/Codex/MCP non-secret bootstrap files are pinned exactly, and
  OAuth tokens, logs, conversations, history, and cache payloads cannot be
  baked into checked-in profile roots silently.
- Tightened the VM Stats Process panel so it reports command executions and
  observed processes as separate ledgers, replaces the unrelated credential-ref
  counter with unique binary counts, and removes tutorial prose from the app UI.
- Made Stats detail payload rendering content-aware: HTTP header fields use an
  HTTP grammar, JSON previews are parsed and formatted as JSON, and non-JSON
  payloads stay as escaped text instead of being forced through a JSON view.
- Cleaned up Profile overview credential inventory so it shows provider,
  last-seen, observed, and injected counts without rendering raw broker
  credential references in the primary UI.
- Moved frontend MCP controls off settings-backed `mcp.servers.*` mutation and
  onto profile-scoped MCP routes. Settings now stays focused on UI/app
  preferences, while the Profile surface owns rules, plugins, MCP, and assets.
- Moved `capsem-process` and the built-in MCP server onto the materialized
  runtime profile directory. Runtime rules, plugins, MCP, model endpoints, and
  service-supplied corp overlays now load from the profile contract instead of
  global settings/user config files.
- Updated the Sessions launcher to render profile-owned icon/name/description
  from `/profiles/list`, check assets per profile, show a download action while
  assets are missing/downloading, and pass the selected `profile_id` on VM
  creation.
- Unified the frontend VM list around one profile-owned VM model: profile
  launches, keyboard creation, and the custom VM dialog now create named
  retained VMs, and both the list and active-VM toolbar expose pause/resume,
  stop/start, fork, and delete without temporary-vs-persistent UI branches.
- Rebuilt the VM Stats tab around the current session database and VM-scoped
  ledger routes. It now surfaces Model, MCP, HTTP, DNS, Files, Process,
  and Security evidence, links directly to raw session DB inspection, and uses
  DB-backed security/detection/enforcement rows for forensic details. Hypervisor
  snapshot internals no longer appear as a generic Stats tab; explicit snapshot
  MCP calls still surface through MCP activity, but host snapshot state is no
  longer written to or exposed from `session.db`.
- Hardened the black-box integration gate so credential-broker tests use an
  isolated file-backed broker store instead of the developer's native keychain,
  and bounded the VM model fixture call so model/credential regressions fail
  quickly with ledger evidence instead of hanging the release test.
- Hardened the integration service startup wait so a clean `capsem-service`
  idempotent exit during a compatible peer-start race keeps probing the UDS
  route instead of failing the release gate before `/list` becomes ready.
- Isolated each integration gate invocation under its own test CAPSEM_HOME so
  focused and full runs do not share stale service sockets, pidfiles, or broker
  stores; `CAPSEM_INTEGRATION_HOME` remains available as an explicit debug
  override.
- Pinned integration-test `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR` and `capsem-service --uds-path` to
  the same process-scoped runtime directory so inherited test environment
  cannot redirect service startup to a foreign singleton socket.
- Made package postinstall hydrate VM assets through `capsem update --assets`
  after copying the selected manifest/profile ledgers. Local dev/corp manifests
  now use `manifest-origin.json` to hydrate from the source asset tree with the
  same hash-named layout and blake3 verification as remote downloads, while the
  package payload remains free of rootfs/initrd/kernel blobs.
- Made `bootstrap.sh` frontend dependency installation non-interactive by
  running `pnpm install` with `CI=true`, matching the full test gate contract
  and avoiding TTY-only confirmation prompts during unattended bootstrap.
- Added VM-scoped snapshot status/list routes backed by the running
  `capsem-process` in-memory snapshot scheduler. Stopped VMs reconstruct
  snapshot status from that VM's snapshot metadata only when requested, and
  migrated session databases drop the old `snapshot_events` table.
- Compact `snapshots_list` output now defaults to created/edited/deleted counts
  so AI-facing MCP responses stay small; callers must pass
  `include_changes=true` to request full per-file snapshot diffs.
- Hardened workspace snapshot storage so capture, compaction, deletion, and
  eviction refuse to operate when snapshot storage or a slot resolves inside
  the live workspace. Regression tests prove snapshot capture/compaction leave
  live workspace entries unchanged and reject symlinked storage back into the
  workspace.
- Hardened `snapshots_revert` against symlink escape/pull-in regressions:
  restore now rejects symlinked parent components in checkpoint storage, avoids
  following live workspace symlinks during no-op checks, and reads regular
  snapshot sources with no-follow file opens. Regression tests cover the old
  “symlink out of workspace, pull outside file bytes into restore” class.
- Clarified the VM Stats process tab by separating command execution rows from
  audit-port process observations, removing the vague “Process Audit Events”
  label from the user-facing table.
- Updated public architecture docs and internal development skills to reflect
  the 1.3 contract: profile-owned assets/rules/MCP/plugins, settings as UI/app
  preferences only, explicit gateway routes, ledger-backed Stats/Inspector,
  and the single SecurityEvent/CEL rule rail.
- Added a `capsem debug` CLI alias for redacted support bundles and expanded
  `capsem status` with profile catalog readiness and corp config
  presence/source/hash information when the service is running.
- Expanded `capsem debug` support bundles with a machine-readable runtime
  boundary contract covering first-party host VSOCK services, explicitly closed
  raw ports, and diagnostic/status routes for bug reports.
- Updated package installation diagnostics: macOS and Linux package scripts now
  write a durable `~/.capsem/logs/install.log`, package builders accept local
  paths plus `file://`, `http://`, and `https://` manifest overrides, and
  service status reports the installed manifest hash and package provenance.
- Hardened macOS `.pkg` and Linux `.deb` package composition so closed
  packages contain the app/binaries, profile config, and selected
  `manifest.json`/`manifest-origin.json` only; VM asset payloads are never
  embedded and are reconciled by the service from the installed manifest.
- Reorganized checked-in config source into `config/settings`, `config/corp`,
  `config/profiles`, `config/docker`, and `config/data`, documented the layout,
  and made source profiles unpinned by contract. `config/settings` owns only
  UI/application preferences; profile/corp own runtime behavior.
- Added per-install timestamped logs under `~/.capsem/logs/install-*.log` plus
  `install-latest.log`, while preserving the aggregate `install.log`.
- Expanded manifest status reporting with mutable-manifest semantics:
  `/profiles/status`, `/profiles/{id}/assets/status`, and CLI status output now
  report the current manifest hash, source, refresh timestamp, and validation
  result instead of treating the install-time hash as immutable.
- Hardened doctor/Ironbank diagnostics so credential-shaped model and OAuth
  probes no longer place synthetic secrets in process argv, and removed the
  guest `shutdown` sysutil alias now that VM shutdown is owned by the TUI.
- Made `capsem-admin manifest generate <assets_dir>` the documented manifest
  production rail for local, release, and corp custom builds; package builders
  consume the selected manifest but no longer document or rely on direct
  generator internals.
- Added a route-backed frontend debug snapshot:
  `window.__capsemDebug.snapshot()` now returns frontend version/log context,
  websocket tail, gateway status, profile catalog status, and corp info for
  pasteable bug reports.
- Updated the session UI to display each VM's backend-provided `profile_id` and
  replaced hard-coded About runtime/kernel claims with live diagnostic status.
- Updated the Profile overview to render route-backed surface availability
  (web, shell, mobile) and broker-visible credential inventory/grant status, so
  profile readiness is visible before users dig into Plugins or raw stats.
- Removed the mistaken checked-in `config/skills/` mirror and restored
  repository `skills/` as the developer skill source; profile/product skills
  must be introduced through the profile ledger instead of a global config
  escape hatch.
- Moved the code profile ledger to `config/profiles/code/profile.toml` and
  materialize generated/installed profiles with the same directory shape, so
  source and runtime config use one profile path contract.
- Added profile-owned VM base-image OBOM evidence: materialized profiles can
  pin `obom.cdx.json` with BLAKE3 hash, size, cdxgen generator metadata, and
  the rootfs hash it describes, and `/profiles/{id}/info` plus
  `/profiles/{id}/obom` expose that base-image-only contract.
- Added profile-owned image payload declarations for the code profile: MCP
  config, apt/Python/npm package lists, build-time hook script, tips, and
  packaged guest-root seed files are now declared from `profile.toml`.
  `capsem-admin profile check` verifies those source payloads plus the root
  seed manifest, and `capsem-admin image build` materializes a pinned,
  self-contained generated guest workspace before invoking the backend builder.
- Renamed profile image hooks from `install.sh`/`files.install` to
  `build.sh`/`files.build` and added Ollama to the shipped Code and Co-work
  profile images through that builder rail, with `zstd` included for the
  official Ollama installer.
- Pruned Ollama CUDA libraries from profile-built images and added the Python
  Ollama SDK to Code and Co-work profiles so local Ollama client tests do not
  require ad-hoc VM package repair or waste guest disk on unused GPU payloads.
- Added non-secret Claude MCP approval state to Code and Co-work profile roots
  so fresh profile-built sessions do not prompt users to trust the built-in
  `capsem` MCP server before agents can use it.
- Added OpenAI, Anthropic, and LiteLLM Python SDKs to the Code and Co-work
  profile package ledgers so Ironbank real-client model tests can run from the
  VM without ad-hoc guest installs.
- Added an Ironbank `capsem-doctor` ledger proof that boots a VM through public
  service routes, runs the hermetic mock protocol lab, and verifies HTTP, DNS,
  MCP, model, tool-call, file, exec, security-rule, and credential broker rows
  agree in `session.db`.
- Made the VirtioFS doctor pip probe hermetic by installing a generated local
  wheel with `--no-index` instead of reaching out to PyPI for `cowsay`.
- Expanded per-architecture VM build ledgers with a `rootfs.config_inputs`
  stage that records declared package config, rendered rootfs install inputs,
  profile root/build-script inputs, and EROFS settings. Installed package
  names and versions remain OBOM evidence, not build-ledger claims.
- Cleaned active architecture/development docs and internal skills around the
  profile/admin image contract: public guidance now points at profile-owned
  package/MCP/rule/root files, generated `target/config`, `capsem-admin image
  build`, build ledgers, and OBOM evidence instead of retired builder
  scaffolding or image-owned provider configuration.
- Added the first profile mutation rail: enforcement and detection rule files
  are now profile-owned files, `Profile` owns core status/check/download and
  MCP tool permission mutation, backend-managed rules carry typed ownership
  annotations, and profile mutations have a DB-writer ledger event.
- Wired service profile routes onto that rail: profile status now verifies
  pinned profile files plus asset hashes, profile asset ensure repairs corrupt
  hash-prefixed assets, MCP tool permission edits write managed profile
  enforcement rules and profile mutation ledger rows, and enforcement/detection
  route listing and authoring compile from profile files plus corp overlays
  without reading or writing user settings.
- Made MCP tool permissions round-trip through the same profile enforcement
  contract: tool list responses now include the effective `allow`/`ask`/`block`
  action and source rule, the frontend edits tools with `{ action }` instead of
  the retired `{ approved: true }` cache shape, and unsupported server
  add/toggle/delete controls are no longer exposed in the MCP UI.
- Clarified MCP builtin display semantics: the profile-owned `local` Capsem MCP
  entry is rendered as built-in capability, not as a stopped external server,
  and frontend runtime counts exclude static builtin MCP entries.
- Split the Profile UI's retired generic `Policy` section into explicit
  `Enforcement` and `Detection` route-backed tabs, with a frontend contract
  test guarding against reintroducing the old policy tab.
- Replaced the Profile UI's raw asset JSON dump with a route-backed asset
  checklist that shows manifest status, VM assets, profile files, verified/
  missing/invalid/downloading state, paths, and size details from
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/assets/status`.
- Disabled debug-only dummy plugins by default and updated the plugin UI to
  show enum-backed mode badges/icons for allow, ask, block, rewrite, and
  disabled states without hiding inactive plugins.
- Added plugin-owned capability metadata to `/profiles/{profile_id}/plugins/*`.
  The credential broker now reports watched event families, supported
  providers, and credential source shapes, and the Plugin UI renders those
  fields alongside broker inventory/counters instead of guessing.
- Updated the Profile rule lists and MCP tool list to use the same
  enum-backed visual language for allow/ask/block/rewrite/detection levels,
  while keeping MCP tool permission changes on the route-backed selector.
- Added an explicit `enabled` field to the security rule contract. Disabled
  rules remain visible in profile enforcement/detection inventories but are
  skipped by `SecurityRuleSet` evaluation and rendered inactive in the UI.
- Grouped Profile enforcement and detection rule lists into `default_rule`
  and profile/corp sections so built-in catchalls are visible without creating
  a second rule engine.
- Added a visible MCP default permission selector backed by `default.mcp`.
  The UI reads and edits `/profiles/{profile_id}/mcp/default/*`, while the
  service mutates the pinned enforcement file and writes the same profile
  mutation ledger used by per-tool MCP overrides.
- Cleaned the admin/doctor/status/debug rails so diagnostics follow the profile
  contract: builder doctor delegates profile validation to `capsem-admin
  profile check`, Justfile asset builds no longer pass legacy guest-config
  knobs, `capsem status`/default health read profile readiness from the service,
  and support bundles collect `settings.toml`/corp diagnostics without
  preserving `user.toml` as a config contract.
- Added structured `capsem.profile_mutation` logs for profile mutation routes
  and ledger writes. MCP tool edits plus enforcement/detection rule upserts and
  deletes now log route requests, validation rejections, ledger-open failures,
  and applied mutations with the same stable profile, target, operation, rule,
  hash, size, status, and mutation identifiers stored in the mutation ledger.
- Updated in-VM diagnostics to validate that the profile-owned Gemini,
  Antigravity, Claude, Codex, and MCP config files are actually projected into
  runtime `/root`, point at the canonical Capsem MCP bridge where applicable,
  and do not contain obvious credential-shaped secrets. The arm64 code-profile
  EROFS rootfs and initrd pins were refreshed from the rebuilt assets.
- Added a coverage-infra guard for release prep: PR Rust coverage now includes
  every workspace crate across the macOS/Linux jobs, Codecov components map
  each crate, and build-chain tests fail if a future crate is left out.
- Hardened AGY/manual-loop diagnostics: missing `capsem-mcp-aggregator` now
  fails loud instead of returning an empty MCP tool stub, unknown private
  model gateways are promoted from bounded JSON protocol shape while preserving
  the original HTTP body, broker credential inventory reports whether a stored
  reference is actually replayable, unknown remote MCP-over-HTTP JSON-RPC is
  promoted into first-party MCP ledger/security events, and boot/dispatch
  consume one typed host VSOCK service registry.

### Added (kernel 7.0 + EROFS)
- Added a stable-kernel upgrade path for guest builds: `kernel_branch = "7.0"`
  now resolves against kernel.org stable releases, while `auto` remains
  LTS-only for conservative release automation.
- Restored Linux KVM guest-memory hardening from the lost Linux line:
  guest memory reads/writes now reject offset overflow, and virtio-blk validates
  complete guest physical ranges before exposing raw host pointers to vectored
  I/O.
- Added experimental EROFS rootfs image generation with `lz4`, `lz4hc`, and
  `zstd` compression. EROFS zstd uses a newer `erofs-utils` container image,
  both guest defconfigs enable kernel-side EROFS zstd decompression, and
  `capsem-init` mounts EROFS when the VM cmdline carries `capsem.rootfs=erofs`.
- Added an opt-in Mac/VZ EROFS DAX probe lane:
  `CAPSEM_EXPERIMENTAL_EROFS_DAX=1` forwards to `capsem-process`, appends
  `capsem.rootfs=erofs-dax`, and makes `capsem-init` attempt an EROFS
  `ro,dax` mount so we can verify whether the VZ block transport can support
  the Linux-style DAX win locally.
- Moved guest NAT setup for the kernel 7.0 lane to `iptables-nft`: defconfigs
  enable nf_tables with the required nft/xt compatibility objects, legacy
  `IP_NF_*` tables are forbidden by tests, `capsem-init` fails closed on NAT
  rule insertion errors, and the rootfs build strips Debian's legacy iptables
  frontend binaries.
- Promoted EROFS lz4hc rootfs assets into the normal asset contract:
  `just build-assets code [arch]`, manifests, service resolution, setup status,
  release attestation, and installer download tests now use `rootfs.erofs` as
  the 1.3 runtime rootfs.
- Removed squashfs as a runtime/build fallback for 1.3 assets: the builder emits
  only `rootfs.erofs`, manifests require EROFS rootfs entries, service/core
  asset resolution no longer selects `rootfs.squashfs`, and in-VM doctor checks
  require `/dev/vda` to be EROFS.
- Added per-architecture VM asset `build-ledger.log` JSONL output from the real
  builder path, covering rendered Dockerfile/build-context hashes, rootfs tar,
  EROFS, kernel assets, tool-version output, compression settings, git revision,
  and project version; release CI uploads the ledger separately for retraceable
  failures.
- Added Python quality gates: Ruff now runs across the repository, and `ty`
  type-checks `src/capsem` in CI plus the local `just test`/`just smoke`
  fast-fail stages.

### Added (benchmarks)
- Added a deterministic `/model/response` fixture to `capsem-mock-server`
  and wired `capsem-bench protocol` to exercise both SSE model streams and
  JSON model responses without public-network dependencies.
- Added a shared `capsem-bench` load harness for MITM, MCP, DNS, and local
  mock-server tests: `CAPSEM_BENCH_CONCURRENCY`,
  `CAPSEM_BENCH_DURATION_S`, `CAPSEM_BENCH_TOTAL_REQUESTS`, and
  `CAPSEM_BENCH_SCENARIOS` now drive one tested config path, and load rows
  share the same request/error/rps/p50/p95/p99/p999/RSS schema.
- Added `build_system/scripts/build/benchmark_report.py`, a Pydantic-validated host reporter that
  renders benchmark JSON as Markdown and can produce matplotlib PNG graphs for
  committed load artifacts.
- Expanded the security-action Criterion benchmark to cover runtime event
  classification for HTTP, DNS, MCP, model, file, and process events in
  addition to rule matching, plugin dispatch, broker substitution, and MCP
  brokered OAuth credential-reference resolution.
- Refreshed the VM `mitm-local` release artifact so the local fixture corpus now
  includes JSON model responses, credential-shaped responses, WebSocket control,
  and session DB/no-secret verification through the profile-selected VM path.
- Added a retired security-rail guard test that fails if old Policy V2,
  domain-policy, or MCP decision-provider code paths reappear in live crates or
  configuration.

### Fixed (install/setup)
- Fixed `capsem stop` on macOS so it unloads the LaunchAgent instead of sending
  SIGTERM to a `KeepAlive` job that launchd immediately restarts. The command
  now verifies the service is no longer loaded before reporting success, so
  stopping Capsem no longer re-enters service startup or prompts for Keychain.
- macOS package postinstall now adds `~/.capsem/bin` to fish shell startup via
  an idempotent `fish_add_path --path "$HOME/.capsem/bin"` entry.
- Rebuilt install/startup flow around service readiness and asset state instead
  of setup wizard state: package installs surface postinstall failures, assets
  resolve through the manifest contract, and the UI waits on the service rather
  than opening against a dead daemon.
- Removed the old setup/onboarding authority path. Provider credentials are now
  discovered or brokered by the credential broker plugin through runtime
  security events and broker-owned references instead of being copied through a
  setup wizard.
- Removed the dead host credential detection module that could scan raw host
  API keys/OAuth files and write them into settings. Credential capture now
  stays behind the credential broker/plugin path, and the retired settings key
  validation surface remains fail-closed at the gateway.
- Stopped settings-derived guest config from materializing brokered provider
  credentials, repository tokens, generated `.git-credentials`, provider allow
  env vars, or AI CLI config files into VM boot env/files. Settings can still
  provide UI/app preferences and explicit non-secret `guest.env.*`; credential
  materialization is broker/plugin-owned.
- Removed the generated/UI `settings.ai.*` provider registry and the stale
  settings-based API-key injection tests. Retired flat AI setting IDs now fail
  validation for both settings file loads and inline corp config installs;
  provider control remains profile/corp rule-owned and credential handling
  remains plugin-owned.
- Removed the retired settings preset subsystem and cleaned root `config/` so
  MITM CA key material lives under `security/keys/` instead of looking like
  editable runtime configuration. Profile assets are selected by URL and
  verified by BLAKE3 hash/size, while release evidence stays in SBOM and
  provenance attestations.
- Fixed local install/package asset materialization so literal build outputs
  and already hash-prefixed assets both install through the same
  manifest-driven hash-prefixed layout, and package/simulated installs now
  include the full host tool set including `capsem-admin`,
  `capsem-tui`, `capsem-mcp-aggregator`, and `capsem-mcp-builtin`.
- Updated the built-in code profile's arm64 asset pins to the current
  EROFS/LZ4HC release artifacts so profile-owned VM boot resolution and the
  installed asset manifest agree.
- Fixed EROFS asset generation to disable the internal superblock CRC feature;
  BLAKE3 remains the release/boot integrity contract, and the repaired LZ4HC
  rootfs now passes `fsck.erofs` before install.
- Hardened the install test harness so the Linux package/systemd user unit is
  stopped before scoped process cleanup, and renamed the internal dev-readiness
  just helper away from setup wording while keeping `capsem setup` removed.

### Changed (release proof)
- Added shared runtime config materialization through
  `capsem-admin profile materialize`: local dev, smoke/test/install recipes,
  and release package jobs now generate `target/config` from checked-in
  `config/` plus `assets/manifest.json` instead of hand-editing source
  profiles. Service test helpers and `just _ensure-service` load
  `target/config/profiles` fail-closed.
- Updated docs and developer skills to document the same generated-config rail:
  checked-in `config/` is source/support material, current-build runtime config
  lives under `target/config`, and EROFS/LZ4HC level 12 is the 1.3 rootfs
  contract rather than a best-effort fallback.
- Restored the Linux-team KVM/FUSE performance work and storage benchmark
  harness into the current EROFS/LZ4HC rail, including bounded VM proof for
  `capsem-bench storage` from the generated profile-selected asset chain.
- Replaced public-service release proof with deterministic local fixtures:
  `capsem doctor` now starts/passes a local `capsem-mock-server`, doctor MCP
  content checks use local text/HTML fixtures, integration tests use local
  allowed/throughput/blocked HTTP paths, and session DB row-generation tests no
  longer curl public services.
- Routed local release-proof network traffic through the normal guest
  iptables-nft redirect rail. The local fixture is only the upstream target;
  doctor, integration, and benchmark paths no longer inject proxy environment
  variables or explicit WebSocket proxy sockets.
- Expanded the shipped plain-HTTP redirect/allowlist mechanics to
  `80`, `3128`, `3713`, `8080`, and `11434`, with doctor and local release
  proof pinned to `127.0.0.1:3713` to avoid colliding with real Ollama.

### Changed (service/API)
- Routed profile mutation ledger writes through the service-owned logger
  `DbHandle::write` path with structured DB failure logging, removing the
  service-side `DbWriter` side path for profile/MCP/rule/plugin edits.
- Updated architecture docs and local development skills to match the 1.3
  contract: settings endpoints are `/settings/info|edit` and expose only
  `tree`/`issues`, install is service/profile-asset readiness rather than a
  setup wizard, and EROFS/LZ4HC is the rootfs contract.
- Moved VM APIs under the explicit `/vms/...` contract. VM creation, listing,
  info, stop, pause, delete, resume, save, fork, exec, logs, inspect, history,
  timeline, and file read/write/list/content routes now live under
  `/vms`/`/vms/{vm_id}`; the retired top-level routes fail closed in the
  service/gateway route contract.
- Tightened the Python service, gateway, and E2E harnesses around the
  profile-owned VM contract: every VM creation and one-shot run test now passes
  the real `code` profile id explicitly, and the gateway mock rejects missing
  profile ids instead of accepting old default-profile payloads.
- Fixed runtime config loading so env-supplied corp/profile config preserves
  direct `corp.rules`, `profiles.rules`, `default`, `plugins`, and refresh
  groups when materializing `MergedPolicies`. Negative-priority corp rules now
  survive into VM processes and are covered by deterministic local MITM
  telemetry proof.
- Added `GET /vms/{vm_id}/status` as the runtime-state endpoint for one VM so
  UI state reads no longer need to treat `/vms/{vm_id}/info` as a status API.
- Added `PATCH /vms/{vm_id}/edit` as a fail-closed VM edit gate: attempts to
  mutate immutable `profile_id` or unknown fields are rejected, and resource
  edits return explicit unsupported status until live edit semantics are
  implemented.
- Added `GET /vms/{vm_id}/save/status` and
  `GET /vms/{vm_id}/fork/status`; because save/fork are synchronous today,
  existing VMs report explicit `idle` operation state rather than fake progress.
- Added VM action route coverage for `POST /vms/{vm_id}/start`,
  `POST /vms/{vm_id}/restart`, and `POST /vms/{vm_id}/reload-profile`.
  `start` uses the existing resume/start path; restart and reload-profile
  verify the VM exists and fail explicitly until real semantics land.
- Added profile inventory routes `GET /profiles/list` and
  `GET /profiles/status`, `POST /profiles/reload`, and
  `GET /profiles/{profile_id}/info`. Profile identity now comes from the typed
  profile catalog: the built-in `code` profile is a real `ProfileConfigFile`,
  route validation no longer uses a hard-coded `default` profile stub, and
  catalog reload/status reports profile readiness through the profile asset
  contract.
- Removed the `ProfileConfigFile::builtin_default()` compatibility alias and
  updated built-in profile validation/tests to name the real `code` profile.
- Fixed CLI and `capsem-mcp` MCP commands to use the real built-in `code`
  profile instead of the retired `default` profile when listing servers/tools,
  refreshing tools, calling profile-scoped MCP tools, or creating one-shot VMs.
  “Default” now refers only to visible default rules, not a hidden profile id.
- Restored the terminal control UI as the `capsem-tui` host binary and made
  `capsem shell` launch it. The TUI is wired to the current `/profiles/list`,
  `/status`, and `/vms/...` contracts, restores Alt-owned shortcuts,
  create/fork/pause/resume/stop/delete/recovery flows, vt-backed terminal
  reconnect behavior, and deterministic text/SVG snapshot inspection.
- Moved the service route table into a single shared router builder so startup
  and route-level tests exercise the same mounted API contract, including
  detection-rule authoring through `/profiles/.../detection/rules/...` and
  ledger readback through `/vms/.../security/latest`.
- Tightened gateway and service release fixtures around the explicit API
  contract: generic fallback proxy paths stay rejected, body-limit tests use
  real file-content routes, MCP credential status remains opaque, and macOS
  process leak detection survives `KERN_PROCARGS2` permission denials.
- Expanded mounted service route contract tests across fail-closed profile/VM
  stubs, profile/settings/corp reads, corp edit/reload, plugin edit/evaluate,
  MCP profile scoping, service-wide security ledgers, and file import/export
  boundary logging.
- Moved remote MCP auth onto the credential broker contract. MCP profile/corp
  config now carries `auth.kind` plus opaque `auth.credential_ref` for bearer
  or OAuth material; raw `bearer_token`/`bearerToken` imports are rejected or
  skipped, secret-bearing MCP headers fail validation, and UI status reports
  `has_auth_credential` instead of token presence.
- Replaced internet-backed MCP manager proof with local recording test
  infrastructure. The normal MCP manager suite now uses a local Streamable
  HTTP MCP server and HTTP recorder to prove broker-owned auth resolution,
  tool discovery, tool dispatch, and fail-closed missing credentials without
  contacting public services.
- Replaced builtin MCP HTTP tool tests that fetched `elie.net` and Wikipedia
  with local static HTTP fixture responses. `fetch_http`, `grep_http`, and
  `http_headers` still exercise the real reqwest/tool/security path, but
  normal tests no longer require public network availability.
- Added a profile-owned rule-file compilation guard: profile enforcement TOML
  and Sigma detection YAML now materialize as `SecurityRuleProfile` and compile
  only through the unified `SecurityRuleSet`/CEL rail, rejecting old policy
  syntax and profile-file attempts to smuggle `corp.rules`.
- Restored the `capsem-admin` executable as a Rust admin front door. Its
  product surface is intentionally narrow: profile validate/check/materialize,
  settings validate, enforcement/detection validate, manifest check/generate,
  and profile-derived image build.
- Added `capsem-admin manifest check|generate` for the current format-2 asset
  manifest. The commands validate top-level `refresh_policy`, report asset
  releases/arches, and regenerate the canonical `assets/manifest.json` from
  built assets without restoring manifest signing or a second asset path.
- Added profile-derived `capsem-admin image build` and moved
  `just build-assets` onto that rail. Asset builds now require an explicit
  profile, validate the profile and rule files first, preserve the Code profile
  defaults, build EROFS `lz4hc` level 12 rootfs assets, and reject raw
  no-profile build attempts.
- Updated the release workflow to call the profile-derived asset build rail
  explicitly (`code` profile) and to package/sign the full restored host binary
  set, including `capsem-admin`.
- Replaced the temporary flat profile asset triplet with per-architecture
  profile asset declarations. `config/profiles/code/profile.toml` now parses as
  the checked-in contract for EROFS/LZ4HC kernel, initrd, and rootfs assets with
  URL/hash/size metadata.
- Made `/profiles/{profile_id}/assets/status` report the selected profile's
  current-architecture asset contract instead of a service-global asset guess,
  including profile id, revision, profile payload hash, expected hashes,
  sizes, source URLs, and present/missing state from the same hash-prefixed
  resolver used by boot.
- Made VM creation profile-explicit. `POST /vms/create`/provision and
  one-shot `run` payloads now require `profile_id`; unknown profiles fail
  before boot state is created, persistent registry rows store `profile_id`,
  fork/save/resume preserve it, and list/info responses expose it. A VM's
  `profile_id` remains immutable after creation.
- Made VM boot preflight and process spawn resolve kernel, initrd, and rootfs
  from the selected profile asset contract. Profile resolution supports the
  approved hash-prefixed downloaded layout and logical-name dev layout, but
  both are derived from profile asset descriptors instead of the old
  service-global file guess.
- Made `/profiles/{profile_id}/assets/ensure` profile-owned. It downloads the
  selected profile's current-architecture kernel, initrd, and rootfs URLs into
  hash-prefixed asset files, verifies each file with the profile BLAKE3 hash,
  updates reconcile status, and skips already-verified profile assets.
- Made `capsem assets status` and `capsem assets ensure` profile-aware. Both
  commands now target the real `code` profile by default, accept `--profile`,
  and call `/profiles/{profile_id}/assets/...` instead of the burned
  `/profiles/default` path; gateway route coverage also forwards
  `/profiles/status` and `/profiles/reload` explicitly.
- Updated the frontend MCP and plugin settings surfaces to target the real
  `code` profile instead of the burned `default` profile id.
- Made startup asset cleanup preserve profile catalog assets and persistent VM
  boot asset pins. Hash-prefixed files referenced by active profile
  descriptors or saved VM pins are retained even when they are not listed in
  the release manifest.
- Made persistent VM lifecycle state pin the selected profile revision, profile
  payload hash, and boot asset descriptors. Create/save/fork/resume preserve
  the pinned profile revision, typed profile payload BLAKE3 hash, and
  kernel/initrd/rootfs name+hash pins; save/fork/resume fail closed when the
  current profile revision, profile payload hash, or boot asset pins drift.
- Added profile management route gates:
  `POST /profiles/create`, `PATCH /profiles/{profile_id}/edit`,
  `DELETE /profiles/{profile_id}/delete`, `POST /profiles/{profile_id}/clone`,
  and `POST /profiles/{profile_id}/validate`. Validation is real over the
  typed `ProfileConfigFile`; mutation routes fail explicitly until profile file
  persistence is implemented instead of writing through settings.
- Added `GET /profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/rules/list`, returning the
  compiled profile rule inventory with source, default-rule, priority, action,
  detection level, and lock metadata so the UI can reflect backend rule
  truth instead of inventing grouping state.
- Added `GET /profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/info`, returning compiled
  enforcement configuration counts by source/action plus default/custom,
  detection, and corp-lock totals. Runtime counters remain table-backed under
  VM enforcement status.
- Added profile-scoped detection rule routes
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/detection/info`,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/detection/rules/list`,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/detection/evaluate`,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/detection/rules/{rule_id}/edit`,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/detection/rules/{rule_id}/delete`, and
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/detection/reload`. They reuse the same compiled
  security-rule contract as enforcement and only list/write rules with an
  explicit `detection_level`.
- Moved asset readiness/reconciliation to profile-owned routes
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/assets/status` and
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/assets/ensure`; retired global `/assets/status` and
  `/assets/ensure` so asset selection stays under the profile contract.
- Removed the retired service-global asset status helper from the service
  binary and converted its reconcile-progress unit coverage to the
  profile-owned asset status contract.
- Added profile-scoped skills route surfaces. Skills `info|list` reflect the
  typed profile manifest; add/edit/delete fail explicitly until profile
  persistence is implemented.
- Removed the profile credential API surface before release: there is no
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/credentials/*` route and no `[credentials]` profile
  block. Credential capture/substitution state belongs to the credential broker
  plugin runtime contract.
- Added profile-scoped assets `info|edit`, plugins `info`, and MCP `info`
  routes. Info routes summarize existing profile/config state; asset edits
  fail explicitly until profile persistence lands.
- Made profile MCP inventory profile-owned. `/profiles/{profile_id}/mcp/...`
  now reads the selected profile's MCP section instead of settings/corp MCP
  sections, `config/profiles/code/profile.toml` explicitly enables the real
  built-in `local` MCP server, and unknown profile server ids fail closed.
- Added service-wide runtime ledger routes `/security/latest|status`,
  `/enforcement/latest|status`, and `/detection/latest|status`. These aggregate
  per-VM `session.db` security-rule ledger rows through `DbReader`; detection
  routes filter to rows with an explicit detection level.

### Added (security event rule spine)
- Replaced callback-shaped Policy V2 authoring with one native rule contract
  over canonical `SecurityEvent`: `[corp.rules.*]`, `[profiles.rules.*]`, and
  provider convenience `[ai.<provider>.rules.*]` all compile into the same
  `SecurityRuleSet`.
- Added typed rule actions `allow`, `ask`, `block`, `preprocess`, `rewrite`,
  and `postprocess`, plus optional `detection_level` metadata for
  `informational`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `critical` detections.
- Added source-aware priority discipline: built-in defaults use the named
  `default` priority sentinel after the numeric user range, user/plugin rules
  default to `10`, corp-locked rules default negative, and non-corp rules
  cannot use negative priorities.
- Added shared external rule files: both user and corp settings can reference
  native enforcement TOML with `[rule_files].enforcement` and Sigma YAML with
  `[rule_files].sigma`; both compile into the same runtime rules. Corp settings
  also carry the future `corp_rule_files.sigma_output_endpoint` integration
  field for SIEM/export delivery.
- Hardened security rule validation with adversarial parser/compiler tests:
  malformed CEL, stale callback fields, callback/table mismatches, invalid
  rule names, invalid priorities, invalid plugin shapes, and atomic rejection
  now fail closed before settings are written.
- Added strict CEL validation against first-party `SecurityEvent` roots
  (`http`, `dns`, `mcp`, `model`, `file`, `process`, and `security`) so stale
  callback-local fields fail before rules persist. Credential substitution
  remains a ledger event type, while snapshot lifecycle state is host recovery
  state exposed through VM snapshot routes rather than CEL roots or
  `session.db`.
- Added typed runtime-family markers for first-party CEL roots versus
  ledger-only `credential.substitution` rows, with regression tests tying the
  markers to `SECURITY_EVENT_CEL_ROOTS`.
- Replaced legacy `[profiles.defaults.*]` rule authoring with the visible
  `[default.<domain>]` contract. Default rules still compile into ordinary late
  CEL rules under `profiles.rules.default_<domain>`, and the old namespace is
  rejected instead of aliased.
- Removed static `tool_config_sources` from settings/profile contracts and the
  settings UI response. Tool config observations now belong to runtime
  plugin/security-ledger evidence with BLAKE3 references, and static
  `tool_config_sources` tables fail closed.
- Removed static credential/config-file metadata from `[ai.*]` provider
  endpoint records. Provider records now carry routing/rule/discovery
  information only; `credential_setting_id`, provider-level `credential_ref`,
  and provider `files` fail closed, and settings provider cards no longer expose
  brokered credential refs.
- Removed provider status from `/settings/info` and the settings UI/model.
  Provider-like behavior is no longer a settings object: profile/corp rules own
  enforcement and credential/plugin runtime status owns credential evidence.
- Stopped the credential broker from writing brokered references into settings.
  Observed credentials are stored behind the credential-store boundary, emitted
  to the substitution/security ledger, and can record provider discovery;
  settings files no longer become a credential-reference inventory.
- Added a security-event engine that runs configured preprocess plugins before
  detection/enforcement, evaluates CEL once against the canonical event, then
  runs configured postprocess plugins only after the decision allows
  materialization.
- Added the typed plugin contract `plugin(SecurityEvent) -> SecurityEvent`;
  plugins own their filtering and runtime state, plugin failures fail closed,
  and plugin effects are recorded in the security rule ledger.
- Added typed profile/corp plugin policy with `mode` and `detection_level`.
  Enabled plugins append `SecurityDetectionEvent` records onto
  `SecurityEvent.detections`, rules with `detection_level` append the same
  reporting vector, and `rewrite` is the canonical mutation mode.
- Extended profile plugin API responses with backend-owned plugin metadata and
  runtime status: stage, version, counters, errors, and brokered credential
  references. The settings UI now reads brokered credential refs only from the
  credential-broker plugin runtime status shape.
- Hardened plugin edit requests so unknown fields are rejected instead of
  ignored. Invalid modes, invalid detection levels, unknown plugins/profiles,
  and credential-reference smuggling attempts fail closed.
- Hardened profile skill mutation routes with typed, strict payloads. Add/edit
  requests now reject unknown fields and empty paths before the current
  profile-persistence gate returns `501 Not Implemented`.
- Added the plugin/detection/enforcement endpoint taxonomy:
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/plugins/list`,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/plugins/{plugin_id}/info`, and
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/plugins/{plugin_id}/edit` report and update
  profile-owned plugin config,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/evaluate` sends a profile-scoped test
  event through the real engine, and
  `/vms/{vm_id}/detection/latest|status` plus
  `/vms/{vm_id}/enforcement/latest|status` remain table-backed ledger views.
- Added enforcement rule-management endpoints:
  `PUT /profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/rules/{rule_id}/edit` and
  `DELETE /profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/rules/{rule_id}/delete`
  validate profile rules against the native `SecurityRuleProfile` compiler
  before writing `user.toml`, and
  `POST /profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/reload` reloads that profile's
  enforcement rules.
- Replaced the retired `/corp-config` provisioning route with
  `PUT /corp/edit`; the gateway and service now reject the old route instead
  of forwarding it.
- Added the rest of the corp plane routes: `GET /corp/info`,
  `POST /corp/validate`, and `POST /corp/reload`, all forwarded explicitly by
  the gateway.
- Replaced the ambiguous `GET|POST /settings` route with
  `GET /settings/info` and `PATCH /settings/edit`; the old magic settings
  route now fails closed in the service and gateway.
- Split core config mutation by owner: `PATCH /settings/edit` now uses the
  UI-settings writer, while VM/security/AI behavior uses profile-owned config
  writers. Credential brokerage state belongs to the broker plugin runtime
  contract.
- Added a first-class profile manifest contract covering profile identity,
  description, icon SVG, web/shell/mobile availability, VM asset selection,
  VM defaults, rule files/default rules, plugins, MCP servers, skills,
  AI/provider convenience rules, and tool config source metadata.
- Profile inventory now sources the built-in `default` profile summary from
  the profile manifest contract instead of service-local placeholder text.
- Removed retired settings utility routes `/settings/lint` and
  `/settings/validate-key`; settings now expose only `info` and `edit` until
  profile/corp validation and credential broker endpoints own those workflows.
- Removed retired settings preset endpoints and UI selector; security/profile
  defaults no longer mutate behavior through `/settings/presets`.
- Removed preset metadata from `/settings/info`; settings responses now carry
  settings tree/issues plus status fields only, not behavior presets.
- Replaced the global `POST /reload-config` route with
  `POST /profiles/{profile_id}/reload`; the old global reload route now fails
  closed in the service and gateway.
- Added `SerializableSecurityEvent` as the public evaluated-event wire DTO:
  every first-party event root is present, absent roots serialize as `null`,
  and raw credential observation buffers are excluded.
- Added credential broker plugin support with file-backed durable storage and
  BLAKE3 `credential:blake3:<hex>` references in broker runtime status, logs,
  and `session.db`; raw credentials stay broker-private.
- Added brokered credential capture from observed HTTP headers/body responses
  and `.env` files, plus upstream-only substitution of broker references for
  allowed HTTP materialization.
- Added a closed runtime security-event identity contract and routed HTTP/net,
  model, MCP, DNS, file, process exec/audit/completion, broker substitution,
  and snapshot session DB rows through the security-engine emitter handoff.
- Removed the old MITM PolicyHook/Policy V2 runtime rails and the MCP built-in
  legacy domain bridge. HTTP request, model request/response, framed MCP
  request/response, MCP built-in HTTP tools, and DNS query blocking now enforce
  through the canonical `SecurityEvent` + CEL rule path before dispatch.
- Added contract tests proving built-in default rules match HTTP, DNS, MCP,
  model, file, and process security events as ordinary late-priority CEL rules;
  specific rules run first, and editing a default rule changes evaluation
  without any hidden network fallback.
- Removed retired web decision settings (`security.web.allow_read`,
  `security.web.allow_write`, `security.web.custom_allow`, and
  `security.web.custom_block`) from defaults, presets, builder schemas,
  frontend fixtures, guest diagnostics, and integration fixtures. Network
  settings now expose only mechanics such as `security.web.http_upstream_ports`;
  HTTP/DNS allow/block behavior belongs to profile security rules.
- Replaced global MCP service/gateway/frontend routes with profile/server
  routes: servers live under `/profiles/{profile_id}/mcp/servers/list`, tools
  live under `/profiles/{profile_id}/mcp/servers/{server_id}/tools/list`, and
  tool edit/call/refresh operations are scoped to the same profile/server path.
- Replaced global enforcement authoring routes with profile-owned routes:
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/evaluate`,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/rules/{rule_id}/edit`,
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/rules/{rule_id}/delete`, and
  `/profiles/{profile_id}/enforcement/reload`.
- Routed explicit file import/export/read/write boundaries through the
  process-owned security-event emitter so `fs_events` and
  `security_rule_events` share the same primary event id without a service-side
  DB writer or fallback logger.
- Added a release guard that keeps session event writes behind
  `capsem_logger::DbWriter`: production protocol, plugin, security, service,
  and process code may not open ad-hoc SQLite writers or insert event rows
  directly.
- Added a security rule forensic ledger: `security_rule_events` stores the
  triggering event id/type, rule id/name/action/detection level, rule snapshot,
  matched `SecurityEvent` payload, and trace id. `security_ask_events` records
  append-only pending/approved/denied ask lifecycle rows.
- Added DB-backed security endpoints: `/vms/{vm_id}/security/latest` returns
  full stored rule ledger rows and `/vms/{vm_id}/security/status` regenerates
  counters from `session.db`.
- Replaced retired top-level VM lifecycle routes with the profile-era VM
  namespace across service, gateway, CLI, MCP, tray, frontend, and tests:
  `POST /vms/{vm_id}/pause`, `DELETE /vms/{vm_id}/delete`,
  `POST /vms/{vm_id}/resume`, `POST /vms/{vm_id}/save`, and
  `POST /vms/{vm_id}/fork`. The gateway now rejects the old
  `/suspend`, `/delete`, `/resume`, `/persist`, and `/fork` route family.
- Moved core VM create/list/info/stop routes into the same VM namespace across
  service, gateway, CLI, MCP, tray, frontend, status aggregation, docs, and
  tests: `POST /vms/create`, `GET /vms/list`,
  `GET /vms/{vm_id}/info`, and `POST /vms/{vm_id}/stop`. The gateway now
  rejects retired `/provision`, `/list`, `/info/{id}`, and `/stop/{id}` paths.
- Added built-in provider-owned AI rules for OpenAI/Codex, Anthropic/Claude,
  Google/Gemini, and Ollama. The rules live under `[ai.<provider>.rules.*]`,
  merge as defaults < user < corp, enforce corp-only negative priorities, and
  compile into deterministic `profiles.rules.*` security-event rules whose
  matches are written to the `security_rule_events` session DB ledger and
  exposed through `/vms/{vm_id}/security/latest`.
- Added Sigma import support that parses Sigma YAML into typed `SecurityRule`
  entries, derives valid rule ids/names, validates generated CEL against
  `SecurityEvent` roots, and keeps security-team detection authoring on the
  same ledger/enforcement rail as native rules.
- Added `capsem-core` security-action microbenchmarks for rule matching,
  action-chain overhead, runtime event classification, and brokered HTTP
  credential materialization.

### Added (observability and benchmarks)
- Added OpenTelemetry-style spans and local-only metrics around MITM/network
  stages, security-event emission, DB enqueue/write behavior, and launch paths
  for benchmark/debug use without exposing upstream telemetry by default.
- Added a local MITM debug benchmark server with HTTP, gzip, SSE/model-like,
  credential-response, deny-target, and WebSocket scenarios so network/security
  hot paths can be measured without public internet variance.
- Added logger-owned DB writer pressure benchmarks and metrics for enqueue
  latency, batch writes, shutdown flushes, and coalesced event pressure.

### Changed (security policy enforcement)
- Unified HTTP, DNS, MCP, model, file, and process detection/enforcement on
  the security-event rule engine. Producers now emit canonical security events,
  evaluate the active `SecurityRuleSet`, and write matched rule rows with the
  same primary event id as the underlying `session.db` event. Credential
  substitution and snapshot lifecycle writes remain canonical ledger event
  types, not fake rule roots.
- Removed the global MCP policy API/UI/CLI surface (`/mcp/policy`,
  `capsem mcp policy`, and frontend MCP policy mutators). MCP runtime endpoints
  now report mechanics only; MCP decisions must be expressed as security rules.
- Removed the old `McpPolicy`/`ToolDecision` decision object from core config.
  Security presets no longer write MCP tool permissions, retired
  `mcp.global_policy`, `mcp.default_tool_permission`, and
  `mcp.tool_permissions` keys fail closed at settings load, and MCP blocking
  tests now use profile security rules.
- Removed `NetworkPolicy::evaluate`, `PolicyDecision`, and
  `NetworkPolicy::is_fully_blocked` from the network engine. Network policy
  code now carries only mechanics such as DNS redirects, HTTP port metadata,
  and body-capture settings; HTTP/DNS allow, ask, block, and default behavior
  must come from profile/corp security rules.
- Removed the remaining domain allow/read/write/default fields from
  `NetworkPolicy` itself. The network object can no longer carry hidden
  domain enforcement state; tests now assert default and provider behavior
  through compiled `SecurityRuleSet` entries.
- Stopped exporting retired web default toggles as guest authority env vars
  (`CAPSEM_WEB_ALLOW_READ` and `CAPSEM_WEB_ALLOW_WRITE`). The guest now relies
  on security events and rules for HTTP/DNS behavior rather than stale
  settings-derived hints.
- Replaced the old callback-demux rule authoring language with CEL over
  first-party event roots. Admin-visible rules use `match = ...` and typed
  actions rather than callback-local `on`/`if`/`decision` fields.
- Preserved enforcement semantics for real boundaries: HTTP/model dispatch,
  DNS handling, framed MCP calls/notifications, file import/export/read/write,
  process exec/audit/completion, credential substitution, and snapshot events
  all pass through the shared security-event emitter and rule ledger.
- Added VM and integration coverage proving configured security rules block,
  ask, or log HTTP, DNS, MCP, model, file, and process events without leaking
  denied request/response payloads into previews.
- Updated the policy product surface and docs around the new
  `SecurityEvent` rule contract, Sigma import, DB-backed latest/info
  endpoints, and forensic `session.db` ledger instead of generated
  callback-specific policy stanzas.

### Fixed (policy rules)
- Fixed model telemetry parsing for explicit/local OpenAI-compatible
  provider paths by carrying the request's provider classification through
  the MITM chunk-hook metadata, so enforcement and SSE interpretation use
  the same provider decision instead of relying only on the network domain.
- Fixed builtin MCP HTTP policy propagation: `capsem-process` now passes
  merged domain allow/block lists to `capsem-mcp-builtin`, so configured
  builtin HTTP denials fail at the policy boundary, avoid upstream
  resolution, and write both `mcp_calls` and `net_events`.
- Fixed a model tool-response policy bypass found during adversarial unit
  testing: an allow rule matching one tool result can no longer let a
  separate secret-bearing tool result in the same provider request bypass a
  block rule.
- Fixed a policy evaluator safety bug found during adversarial testing:
  a missing field no longer satisfies a negative comparison such as
  `provider != "local"`.
- Fixed policy settings UI crashes found during browser verification by
  tolerating omitted live metadata arrays and deduplicating generated rule
  keys before rendering Svelte keyed rows.
- Fixed MITM integration fixture discipline: fake upstreams now drain the
  full `Content-Length` body and upstream task panics fail the test instead
  of only printing noisy background panics.
- Fixed warnings-as-errors issues found during policy verification by
  removing a redundant setup detection closure and switching settings
  endpoint env-serialization tests to an async mutex.
- Fixed an MCP telemetry leak: pre-dispatch block/ask denials now avoid
  writing raw denied request arguments into `mcp_calls.request_preview`.
- Fixed MITM body handling regressions found during T6 verification:
  HTTP decompression now honors `Content-Encoding: gzip` instead of raw
  gzip magic bytes, and decoded responses drop stale compressed
  `Content-Length`/size hints so guest delivery cannot truncate.
- Fixed suspend/resume recovery hardening found during T7: `.vzsave`
  checkpoints are fsynced before process exit, service registry suspended
  state is cleared only after resume readiness, and failed Apple VZ warm
  checkpoints are archived before a persistent cold-boot fallback recovers
  workspace/overlay state.
- Fixed the smoke leak-detector false positive where concurrent pytest
  invocations shared one leak-attribution file and could report another
  still-running pytest process's service fixture as a leak; `just smoke`
  now gives each pytest phase a distinct leak-log namespace.

### Fixed (mitm-mcp-unification T4 coverage hardening)
- Preserved all JSON-RPC request id shapes in framed MCP telemetry:
  string, numeric, and null ids now populate `mcp_calls.request_id`
  instead of only unsigned numeric ids.
- Corrected the sprint tracker T5 scope: configured external MCP tool
  calls are inspected at the framed MITM MCP boundary; any remaining
  downstream host-side egress concern must be named separately.
- Expanded framed MCP coverage across Rust, VM E2E, and in-VM doctor
  diagnostics for malformed JSON recovery, oversized guest requests,
  corrupted-frame recovery after an established MCP frame stream,
  notification interleaving, non-`tools/call` timeout telemetry, and
  persistent stop/resume reconnect.
- Updated the T4 coverage review notes and benchmark log with the bugs
  found during review, `session.db` sanity evidence, and fresh
  `mcp-load` numbers after the hardening pass.

### Changed (mitm-mcp-unification T4 cutover)
- **Guest MCP now uses framed MITM transport by default.**
  `/run/capsem-mcp-server` relays stdio JSON-RPC over bounded MCP
  frames on `vsock:5002`, carries per-frame process attribution, emits
  explicit disconnect errors for in-flight JSON-RPC requests, and avoids
  automatic replay of non-idempotent `tools/call` requests after a
  transport drop.
- Removed the legacy guest MCP router on `vsock:5003`: deleted
  `capsem-core/src/mcp/gateway.rs`, removed `VSOCK_PORT_MCP_GATEWAY`,
  removed 5003 vsock dispatch/classification, and updated guest
  diagnostics, docs, skills, and benchmarks to describe the MITM MCP
  endpoint as the canonical guest MCP path.
- Added the `mitm.mcp_disconnects_total` metric and VM E2E coverage
  proving the default guest relay writes populated `mcp_calls` rows,
  live policy reload affects an existing connection, concurrent parent
  processes preserve `mcp_calls.process_name`, tool timeouts record
  terminal errors, external stdio MCP tools still dispatch, and legacy
  `vsock:5003` refuses guest connections.
- Fixed `build_system/scripts/doctor/check_session.py` so `just inspect-session <id>` works
  with current run-session directories and older system Python versions.

### Changed (development process)
- Strengthened the Capsem sprint/testing skills to require an explicit
  functional-slice proof matrix for non-trivial work: unit/contract,
  functional, adversarial, E2E/VM, telemetry, and performance evidence
  must be named in sprint trackers, with any missing coverage recorded
  as visible debt instead of implied by benchmarks or unit tests.
- Expanded the MCP development skill with the framed MITM MCP hardening
  matrix: parser/interpreter adversarial cases, dispatch coverage,
  policy rule enforcement, telemetry assertions, VM E2E checks, and the
  aggregator DB-free boundary.

### Fixed (mitm-mcp-unification T3 hardening)
- **Framed MCP now consumes request stream ids before JSON parsing,**
  so a valid frame with invalid JSON cannot reuse the same stream id for
  a later request. Parser-level failures still return JSON-RPC parse
  errors, complete the stream id, and avoid writing misleading
  `mcp_calls` rows.
- **`capsem-service` now forwards framed MCP runtime knobs to
  `capsem-process`.** The child-process env allowlist includes
  `CAPSEM_HOME`, `CAPSEM_MCP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECS`,
  `CAPSEM_MCP_TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT_SECS`, and
  `CAPSEM_MCP_TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT_CEILING_SECS`, keeping service/process
  config roots aligned and allowing E2E tests to exercise real timeout
  limits.
- Added framed MCP VM E2E coverage for builtin `tools/call`, configured
  external stdio tools, live policy reload on an already-open connection,
  concurrent process attribution, slow-tool timeout telemetry, and
  `session.db` policy/preview assertions.
- Added a static regression guard proving the low-privilege
  `capsem-mcp-aggregator` crate remains free of session DB dependencies
  and audit writes.

### Added (mitm-mcp-unification T3 MITM MCP endpoint)
- **Framed MCP now dispatches through a real MITM-owned endpoint
  instead of borrowing the legacy MCP gateway handler.** `MitmProxyConfig`
  owns `McpEndpointState`; the framed path routes initialize,
  tool/resource/prompt list, tool calls, resource reads, and prompt gets
  through the low-privilege `AggregatorClient`; and the MITM frame layer
  writes `mcp_calls` telemetry directly through the session `DbWriter`.
  The aggregator remains DB-free.
- Added method-aware framed MCP timeouts: non-`tools/call` methods default
  to 60s, `tools/call` defaults to 300s, tool-call catalog timeout
  overrides are clamped by a 300s ceiling, and timeout failures return
  JSON-RPC errors while recording terminal `mcp_calls` rows with
  `decision=error`.

### Added (mitm-mcp-unification T2 decision provider)
- **Framed MCP calls now record audit-only policy decisions in
  `mcp_calls`.** The MITM MCP frame path builds an owned decision
  request from the interpreter summary, preserving process name,
  method classification, request preview, and BLAKE3 request hash for
  future remote corp forwarding. The local v1 provider emits only
  `allow` or `deny` actions, maps warning policy to `allow`, evaluates
  tool calls at per-tool granularity, evaluates resource/prompt reads
  at server granularity, and stores `policy_mode`, `policy_action`,
  `policy_rule`, and `policy_reason` through the logger schema,
  writer, reader, and session triage output.
- Added the T2 policy test matrix for exact tool name, exact MCP
  resource URI, prompt/tool argument name, prompt/tool argument value,
  nested return value, deny-over-allow precedence, live policy mutation,
  response-time decisions, actual framed request blocks, and sanitized
  framed response blocks. The framed tests now drive the MCP frame
  transport into a real `session.db` and assert both telemetry previews
  and policy fields on the resulting `mcp_calls` rows.
- Framed MCP deny decisions now enforce as well as log: request-rule
  denies short-circuit before aggregator dispatch, and return-value
  denies replace the original MCP result with a policy error before it
  reaches the guest.

### Added (mitm-mcp-unification T1 parser/interpreter)
- **Framed MCP over `vsock:5002` now has a bounded parser and
  interpreter instead of relying on the T0 spike shape.** The MITM
  MCP frame path validates frame length/flags, enforces monotonic
  nonzero request `stream_id`s while reserving `stream_id=0` for
  notifications, bounds JSON-RPC payload parsing before deserialize,
  classifies MCP request/notification methods, extracts server/tool/
  resource/prompt names for the known MCP call families, emits method
  metrics, and recovers from corrupt-but-bounded frames by returning
  JSON-RPC invalid-request errors before continuing the stream.

### Changed (exec timeout contract)
- **`capsem exec` and `capsem run` no longer impose a hidden default
  command timeout.** Omitting `--timeout` now waits for command
  completion, which matches long-running user jobs such as builds,
  installs, migrations, and `capsem-bench mcp-load`. Explicit
  `--timeout <seconds>` still applies a service-side deadline. The
  process-layer exec watchdog was removed; transport delivery remains
  covered by the control bridge's Ack/AckReply replay layers.

### Changed (rustfmt sweep)
- Ran a one-time workspace `cargo fmt` sweep while landing T1 so future
  sprint diffs start from the same formatter baseline.

### Added (mitm-mcp-unification T0 wire gate)
- **Framed MCP-over-MITM transport is now benchmark-gated for the
  MCP unification sprint.** Added a bounded `MC` frame envelope in
  `capsem-proto`, a MITM classifier branch for framed MCP on
  `vsock:5002`, and an explicit `CAPSEM_MCP_TRANSPORT=framed`
  mode in the guest MCP relay. The T0 spike still routes through
  the existing aggregator/policy/MCP telemetry path so the wire
  comparison stays fair. Fresh same-hardware `mcp-load` artifacts
  are recorded at
  `benchmarks/baselines/mcp-load/baseline-pre-mitm-unification.json` and
  `benchmarks/baselines/mcp-load/baseline-framed-mitm-unification-t0.json`.
  Framed selected: rps +8.6% / +4.8% / -6.4% / +5.4% and p99
  -31.9% / -23.9% / +7.8% / -31.0% at concurrency 1/10/50/200,
  with zero errors on both transports.

### Fixed (mcp/file_tools: truncate_path panic on non-ASCII paths -- AB-007)
- **`truncate_path` no longer panics on paths whose suffix
  byte offset lands inside a multibyte UTF-8 sequence.** The
  legacy implementation used `path.len()` (bytes) and
  `&path[path.len() - (max - 3)..]` (byte slice). For example,
  a path of 40 `日` chars + 1 ASCII char (121 bytes) with
  max = 33 panicked with `start byte index 91 is not a char
  boundary; it is inside '日'`. Both call sites
  (`render_changes` and the snapshot list renderer) walk
  user-supplied paths, so any non-ASCII path could crash
  snapshot rendering for the whole VM. The new implementation
  counts and slices by character, falling back to a
  no-ellipsis suffix for `max <= 3` so ill-typed callers
  cannot bring down the tool. Eight regression tests cover
  ASCII-under, ASCII-over, Unicode-under (keeps as-is even
  when byte length exceeds max), Unicode-boundary panic
  repro, Unicode-over (correct char count), empty path,
  `max == 3`, and `max == 0`.

### Fixed (security: deep-link JS injection -- AB-003)
- **`capsem-app::dispatch_deep_link` no longer interpolates
  `--connect` / `--action` values into JavaScript that runs in
  the desktop webview.** The previous code only escaped single
  quotes and embedded the values into a single-quoted JS
  literal that was passed to `window.eval`. A trailing
  backslash, a newline, or a payload like
  `x\'); alert(1); //` broke out of the string and ran as
  code -- in a webview that holds the gateway auth token, so
  effective full local capsem control. New helpers
  `build_deep_link_payload` (returns a `serde_json::Value`)
  and `build_deep_link_script` embed the payload via JSON
  serialization, which is a strict subset of valid JS object/
  string literals; every backslash, quote, control char, and
  high-bit code point is escaped by construction. Tests added
  cover plain values, single quote, backslash, newline, the
  injection-payload repro, and a JSON round-trip across a
  high-entropy input string.

### Fixed (mitm-redesign T3 closure -- production bug, dns-load reveal)
- **DNS cache returned the original query id for every cache hit.**
  The TTL-honoring answer cache (T3.f) stored wire-format response
  bytes verbatim, including the 16-bit DNS transaction id in
  bytes 0-1. Cache hits returned those bytes without rewriting the
  id, so subsequent queries to the same `(qname, qtype, qclass)`
  always echoed the FIRST query's id. Downstream resolvers (which
  match responses to outstanding queries by id, RFC 1035 sec 4.1.1)
  would discard the cached response as not-mine, causing 100%
  query failure once the cache warmed up. Surfaced by the
  `capsem-bench dns-load` in-VM run during T3 closure: the run
  reported ~99.999% errors, and an inline diagnostic showed the
  exact pattern -- 5 sequential queries with random ids all
  returned the same id (the first query's). Fix: `DnsAnswerCache::get`
  takes a new `query_id: u16` parameter and patches the response
  bytes' id field on every hit before returning. New regression
  tests `cache_hit_patches_query_id_into_response` (asserts the
  patch happens with two different ids on the same key) and
  `cache_hit_with_zero_query_id_zeroes_bytes` (defensive: id=0
  must overwrite, not skip the patch). Existing 18 cache tests
  updated to pass through the new arg. capsem-core lib at 1693
  tests now (+2 regression). Workspace clippy clean.

### Fixed (mcp: corp precedence -- AB-002)
- **Corp-defined MCP servers can no longer be shadowed by a
  same-name user manual entry.** The build pipeline in
  `crates/capsem-core/src/mcp/mod.rs::build_server_list_with_builtin`
  used a first-wins HashSet but processed entries in the order
  builtin → auto-detected → user → corp, so corp was last and
  was silently skipped on collision. A user typing the same
  name as a corp-injected server would win the URL, headers,
  and bearer token, contradicting the documented `corp > user
  > defaults` policy in `web/docs/architecture/settings.md` and
  the "corp_locked" model. Corp definitions are now processed
  first, so the first-wins rule enforces the documented trust
  order. Same-name user entries are skipped; unique-name user
  and auto-detected entries are unaffected. Tests added:
  `build_server_list_corp_shadows_user_on_same_name`,
  `build_server_list_unique_user_server_survives_with_corp_present`,
  `build_server_list_corp_enabled_override_on_user_server`.
  `web/docs/src/content/docs/architecture/mcp-aggregator.md`
  reordered to match the new processing order.

### Fixed (security: gateway CORS -- AB-001)
- **Gateway CORS now does an exact-host check on the Origin
  header instead of a string prefix match, closing a path that
  could leak the gateway auth token to attacker-controlled
  pages.** The previous predicate accepted any origin starting
  with `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, `https://...`,
  or `tauri://`, so origins like `http://localhostevil.com`,
  `http://127.0.0.1.evil.example`, and `tauri://evil.example`
  passed CORS. Combined with `GET /token` being exempted from
  the auth middleware (it is gated only by loopback peer IP --
  which a victim's own browser satisfies), a malicious page
  could read `gateway.token` cross-origin and drive the local
  capsem service. The new
  `crates/capsem-gateway/src/cors.rs::is_allowed_origin` parses
  the Origin as a URI and accepts only exact matches for
  `http`/`https` to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`, plus
  `tauri://localhost`; any path/userinfo/query/fragment, any
  unknown scheme, and any host suffix attack are rejected.
  22 unit tests cover the positive and negative matrix and the
  predicate is now shared between production and the
  integration test in `main.rs` so they cannot drift.

### Fixed (mitm-redesign T3 closure -- in-VM gate)
- **Host vsock listener registration was missing
  `VSOCK_PORT_DNS_PROXY` (5007) and `VSOCK_PORT_AUDIT` (5006).**
  In-VM smoke surfaced the DNS half: `capsem-dns-proxy` queries
  failed with "Connection reset by peer (os error 104)" because
  the host kernel had no listener for vsock port 5007 to accept
  on. `crates/capsem-core/src/vm/boot.rs::vsock_ports` now
  includes both 5006 and 5007 alongside the existing 5000-5005,
  so the Apple VZ + KVM hypervisor backends register listeners
  on every port `dispatch_aux_connection` knows how to handle.
  The audit case was a latent bug -- `audit_events` had been
  silently empty in every session since the audit feature
  landed -- now incidentally fixed alongside the DNS one.
- **Diagnostics: `test_dns_resolves_to_local` (test_sandbox.py)
  and `test_allowed_domain` still asserted the legacy
  `10.0.0.1` dnsmasq sentinel.** Updated to match the T3.4
  cutover: DNS now resolves to a real upstream IP via the
  capsem proxy (accepting either IPv4 or IPv6 first-token
  shape, since some upstreams return AAAA-only). The
  `test_allowed_domain` step-by-step diagnostic now uses the
  resolved hostname for TCP/TLS steps instead of hard-coding
  10.0.0.1. `test_dns_blocked_domain_returns_nxdomain` was
  policy-dependent (the user's `~/.capsem/user.toml` may
  override `api.openai.com.allow`); replaced with
  `test_dns_nxdomain_propagates_from_upstream` which uses an
  RFC 2606 `.invalid` TLD that no upstream can resolve --
  a clean policy-independent NXDOMAIN E2E test that pre-T3
  dnsmasq would have wrongly answered with 10.0.0.1.
- **In-VM E2E gate result.** With the boot.rs fix + diagnostic
  updates: `capsem-doctor -k 'dns or proxy_listening or
  iptables_redirect'` returns 14/14 PASS in a temp VM. The
  full DNS path is validated end-to-end: libc -> iptables nat
  53 -> 1053 -> capsem-dns-proxy -> vsock 5007 -> host hickory
  handler -> upstream forward (1.1.1.1) OR NXDOMAIN
  short-circuit -> answer back. `dns_events` rows populate with
  `trace_id`, source_proto, upstream_resolver_ms.
  `pgrep dnsmasq` returns nothing.

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `f.proptest`)
- **proptest property-based tests for the DNS wire codec.** New
  `crates/capsem-core/src/net/parsers/dns_parser/proptests.rs`
  with 7 properties (256 random cases each by default) closing
  the loop alongside the cargo-fuzz targets:
  - `parse_query_round_trip`: build a query with arbitrary
    name + qtype + id, parse it back, assert id / qname / qtype
    / qclass / extra_questions match.
  - `build_nxdomain_preserves_question`: NXDOMAIN response built
    from an arbitrary query parses back to a question with the
    same id / qname / qtype / qclass.
  - `build_servfail_preserves_question`: same shape, ServFail
    rcode.
  - `build_redirect_preserves_question_for_a`: redirect response
    with N arbitrary IPv4 IPs lands all N as A records (no
    cross-family filter loss).
  - `build_redirect_filters_cross_family`: redirect with
    1 IPv4 + 1 IPv6 + an A query yields exactly 1 answer
    (the IPv4) -- the cross-family filter holds.
  - `parse_query_does_not_panic_on_arbitrary_bytes`: 0..2000
    arbitrary bytes never panic. Mirrors the cargo-fuzz target's
    safety contract so a regression surfaces in `cargo test`
    even without nightly + cargo-fuzz installed locally.
  - `build_nxdomain_does_not_panic_on_arbitrary_bytes`: same.
  Strategies: `dns_name_strategy()` produces 2-3 label
  syntactically-valid lowercase DNS names; `qtype_strategy()`
  picks from A/AAAA/TXT/MX/CNAME/SRV/CAA/NS/SOA/PTR/HTTPS/ANY.
  New dev-dep `proptest = "1"` (test-only, no production
  surface). capsem-core lib at 1691 tests now (was 1684).

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `f.cache`)
- **TTL-honoring LRU answer cache for the DNS proxy.** New
  `crates/capsem-core/src/net/dns/cache.rs` shipping
  `DnsAnswerCache`: bounded LRU (default 1024 entries) keyed on
  `(qname, qtype, qclass)`, value is the wire-format answer bytes
  + `expires_at` derived from `min(answer_TTL, max_cache_ttl)`
  with `[60s, 300s]` clamp (DEFAULT_MAX_TTL_SECS / MIN_TTL_SECS).
  Lazy expiry: an expired entry is popped on the next lookup +
  counted as a miss. Cache **eligibility**: only `Decision::Allowed`
  responses with rcode=0 are inserted -- block + redirect
  re-evaluate every query (admin can change either at any moment),
  and SERVFAIL / NXDOMAIN from upstream are not persisted (avoids
  amplifying a transient upstream blip into 5 minutes of wrong
  answers). Cache **coherence**: `cache.get()` re-checks
  `is_fully_blocked` AND `find_dns_redirect` on every hit -- a
  domain that becomes blocked or redirected after we cached its
  answer is invalidated lazily on the next access (the entry is
  popped + counted as a miss). Three new metrics:
  `mitm.dns_cache_hits_total`, `mitm.dns_cache_misses_total`,
  `mitm.dns_cache_evictions_total`. New `lru = "0.18"` capsem-core
  dep (small pure-Rust crate). Wired into `DnsHandler` via the
  new `with_cache` constructor; `with_default_resolver` enables
  it by default with default config. `new` (no cache) constructor
  is preserved so existing tests can assert the upstream path
  always runs without cache-hit interference. 18 cache unit tests
  (insert/get round-trip, qtype/qclass key independence, capacity
  eviction with LRU order, TTL clamps to MIN/MAX bounds,
  garbage-input falls back to MIN, NoData answer falls back to
  MIN, min-across-records, clear, default constants pinned) + 8
  handler integration tests (cache hit short-circuits upstream
  via blackhole-after-warmup, policy-now-blocks invalidates
  lazily, policy-now-redirects invalidates lazily, block path
  still NXDOMAINs without consulting cache, cache_hits_total +
  cache_misses_total metrics fire, NXDOMAIN-from-upstream is not
  cached, with_default_resolver enables caching, new() leaves
  cache=None). capsem-core lib at 1684 tests now (was 1658).
  Workspace clippy clean.

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `f.observability`)
- **DNS path metrics + structured tracing span.** Three new
  metric names registered alongside the existing MITM ones:
  `mitm.dns_queries_total{decision}` (allowed / denied /
  redirected / error), `mitm.dns_handle_duration_ms` (histogram,
  end-to-end), `mitm.dns_upstream_duration_ms` (histogram,
  upstream-forward path only -- absent on policy short-circuit),
  `mitm.dns_upstream_failures_total`. `DnsHandler::handle` is now
  wrapped in a `mitm.dns.query` info-span recording `qname`,
  `qtype`, `decision`, `rcode`, and `upstream_ms` on exit so a
  single `RUST_LOG=capsem::net::dns=debug` traces one query from
  parse to answer. The handler was refactored to a thin
  `handle()` (span + metric emission) wrapping `handle_inner()`
  (the decision tree) so every exit path goes through the same
  observability stamp -- no drift between block / redirect /
  forward / error branches. 5 new tests against
  `metrics_util::DebuggingRecorder` assert the right counter
  fires per decision label, the upstream histogram is absent on
  policy short-circuit but present on the forward path, and
  `dns_upstream_failures_total` increments on resolver error.
  `metrics_util` was already a dev-dep from the T1 sprint;
  facade-only emission means a no-op overhead in production
  until T5 wires the OTel exporter (same shape as the existing
  MITM metrics).

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `e`)
- **`capsem-bench dns-load` harness.** New
  `guest/artifacts/capsem_bench/dns_load.py` mirrors the
  mitm-load shape: drives the DNS proxy at concurrency
  1/10/50/200, measures rps + p50/p95/p99/p999 latency, counts
  errors, and reports a per-level rcode distribution
  (`{"denied": 1234}` for the policy-block path,
  `{"allowed": 1234}` for the upstream-forward path) so the
  output dovetails with `dns_events.decision` for cross-checks.
  Defaults to `api.openai.com` (a fully-blocked domain in the
  dev policy) so every query hits the NXDOMAIN short-circuit
  path -- isolates the proxy's per-query cost from real upstream
  variance. Override via `CAPSEM_BENCH_DNS_QNAME` /
  `_QTYPE` / `_DURATION` / `_TIMEOUT`. The harness builds DNS
  wire-format queries by hand (no dns-python dep needed) so the
  guest's bundled python is enough; the encoder helpers
  (`_encode_qname`, `_build_query`, `_decode_rcode`,
  `_RCODE_DECISION` map) come with 7 host-side unit tests
  pinning the wire format + the rcode-to-Decision lock-step.
  Wired into `__main__.py` as the new `dns-load` mode (gated
  off `all` like mitm-load -- 40s of pure proxy stress would
  dominate a casual `capsem-bench all` run). Baseline JSON
  capture deferred to junior who owns the bench runner this
  session per the resume prompt.

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `d`)
- **`DnsRedirect` policy rule -- admin-configured DNS overrides.**
  New `DnsRedirect { matcher, qtype, answers, ttl }` rule kind on
  `NetworkPolicy::dns_redirects` lets an admin override DNS
  resolution for a specific qname (and optionally a specific
  qtype). The DNS handler checks redirects AFTER `is_fully_blocked`
  (a blocked domain stays NXDOMAIN; redirect never weakens block)
  and BEFORE the upstream forward (no network round-trip when the
  answer is pinned locally). Use cases: redirect telemetry domains
  to a local trap, simulate an unreachable name with a deterministic
  IP for test runs, /etc/hosts-style overrides without modifying
  the guest. New `Decision::Redirected` variant on
  `capsem_logger::events::Decision` (string `"redirected"`) so
  `dns_events` rows surface override hits via
  `WHERE decision = 'redirected'`. Builder
  `dns_parser::build_redirect_response(query_bytes, &[IpAddr],
  ttl) -> Result<Vec<u8>>` synthesizes A/AAAA answer records
  filtered by qtype (cross-family IPs silently skipped, yielding
  the standard "name exists, no record of that type" NoError +
  zero-answers shape). 9 new policy unit tests + 11 new handler
  integration tests + 8 new builder unit tests covering exact /
  wildcard match, qtype filter, qtype=None matches anything,
  cross-family filtering, mixed-family yields only matching,
  block-overrides-redirect (block path runs first), TTL
  propagation, multiple IPs, empty-answers nodata, and
  no-match-falls-through-to-upstream. capsem-core lib at 1653
  tests now (was 1591). Workspace clippy clean.

### Added (mcp-concurrency T3 angle 2)
- **Pooled rmcp stdio peers for the local builtin MCP server.** The
  gateway can now spawn N independent stdio subprocesses for one
  MCP server and round-robin tool calls across them, removing
  rmcp 1.6's per-`Peer` mpsc → driver-task → stdin funnel as a
  singleton bottleneck. New fields on `McpServerDef`: `pool_size`
  (None / 0 / 1 = no pool, current behavior; >1 = N peers) and
  `pool_safe_tools` (allowlist of tool names safe to round-robin;
  others pin to `peers[0]` so per-process state stays consistent).
  HTTP servers ignore `pool_size` (HTTP/2 multiplexes natively).
  Builtin pool defaults to `min(available_parallelism, 4)` (matches
  the inflight-cap rule from `d88a714`). `CAPSEM_MCP_BUILTIN_POOL`
  overrides for tuning / debugging (set to 1 to force pre-pool
  behavior; clamped [1, 16]). `pool_safe_tools = [echo, fetch_http,
  grep_http, http_headers]`; snapshot tools stay pinned to
  `peers[0]` (their `AutoSnapshotScheduler` is per-process and N
  peers would diverge silently). Single-shot smoke at the dynamic
  default on M5 Max (pool=4): c=200 mcp-load p99 = 28.2 ms (vs
  sprint gate ≤ 35 ms), rps = 9591 (vs sprint gate ≥ 8000); c=10
  rps 3628 → 8794 (+143 %) — the rmcp stdio funnel disappearing
  at low contention.
- **`CAPSEM_BUILTIN_PEER_INDEX` env var** on `capsem-mcp-builtin`.
  Peer 0 keeps the original `mcp-builtin.lock` singleton; peers
  1..N use `mcp-builtin-{idx}.lock` so the `capsem_guard::install`
  per-session-dir guard doesn't make pool peers exit 0 with
  "another instance holds the lock".
- **`CAPSEM_MCP_BUILTIN_POOL` added to capsem-service env-allowlist**
  (both create and resume paths) so ops/bench can tune without
  rebuilding.

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `c`)
- **cargo-fuzz harnesses for the DNS wire-format codec.** Four
  libFuzzer targets at `crates/capsem-core/fuzz/fuzz_targets/`:
  `parse_query`, `build_nxdomain`, `build_servfail`, and
  `round_trip` (asserts that if `parse_query` succeeds then
  `build_nxdomain` succeeds AND the response re-parses to the
  same qname/qtype/qclass -- catches divergence between the parse
  and rebuild paths that would let malformed queries escape
  NXDOMAIN gating). Each `corpus/<target>/` is pre-seeded with
  the T3.b `.bin` fixtures for fast structural coverage. The
  `fuzz/` directory is a standalone cargo workspace so libFuzzer's
  instrumentation flags don't leak into the parent workspace's
  normal builds. Plan acceptance from `T3-dns-proxy.md`: each
  target must survive `cargo +nightly fuzz run <target> --
  -max_total_time=60` clean (run path documented in
  `crates/capsem-core/fuzz/README.md` alongside the triage
  workflow for any crash artifact).

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `b`)
- **dns_parser on-disk wire-format fixture corpora.** 13 raw DNS
  wire-byte `.bin` fixtures live at
  `crates/capsem-core/src/net/parsers/dns_parser/fixtures/`,
  covering simple A / AAAA / TXT / MX / CAA / HTTPS queries, the
  multi-question case, NXDomain + ServFail synthetic responses,
  truncated query, header-only, lying-qdcount, and the
  compression-self-loop adversarial case. Loaded via
  `include_bytes!()` at compile time so test runs don't hit the
  filesystem. 13 round-trip tests + an `all_fixtures_have_nonzero_length`
  pin (catches "include_bytes! pointed at an empty file" failure
  modes) wire them into the existing dns_parser test suite.
  Bootstrapped + regenerated by a new
  `crates/capsem-core/examples/dns_fixture_gen.rs` (separate
  compilation unit so the include_bytes! / regen chicken-and-egg
  doesn't bite). Plain English: a hickory-proto upgrade that
  changes the on-the-wire encoding of any of these query shapes
  lights up in the test diff before it bites a real query, and
  cargo-fuzz can corpus-seed from these exact bytes.

### Added (mitm-redesign T3 follow-up `a`)
- **dns_parser test breadth: record types + adversarial.** 32 new
  unit tests covering CNAME / NS / SOA / PTR / SRV / CAA / HTTPS /
  ANY / NULL / HINFO / AXFR / IXFR record types, all five DNS
  classes (IN / CH / HS / NONE / ANY), and risk-shape inputs:
  empty / single-byte / header-only / lying-qdcount / oversized
  qdcount=65535 / label compression self-loop / forward pointer
  past EOF / label > 63 bytes / NUL byte in label / truncated
  question section / max-label (63 bytes) accepted / NXDOMAIN
  preserves obscure qtype (CAA) and non-IN qclass / SERVFAIL
  rejects undecodable input. Total dns_parser tests: 46 (was 14).
  No production code changed -- pure additive coverage so a
  hickory-proto upgrade that quietly drops a record-type variant
  or breaks compression-bomb defense lights up before it bites a
  real query.

### Changed (mitm-redesign T3.4)
- **Guest cutover from dnsmasq to capsem-dns-proxy.** The
  in-guest dnsmasq fake (which resolved every name to the sentinel
  `10.0.0.1` so the MITM proxy could intercept connections) is
  gone. `capsem-init` now launches `capsem-dns-proxy` (T3.2) and
  installs iptables nat rules redirecting UDP/TCP port 53 to the
  proxy's `127.0.0.1:1053` listener. DNS queries now traverse the
  vsock envelope to the host's hickory-backed handler (T3.1)
  which applies the shared `NetworkPolicy` and forwards to a real
  upstream nameserver. `dig anthropic.com` from a guest returns a
  real answer; `dig api.openai.com` returns NXDOMAIN with the
  decision logged in `dns_events` (T3.3). The `dnsmasq` package
  is dropped from `guest/config/packages/apt.toml`, so the next
  rootfs rebuild leaves the binary out of the squashfs entirely.
  Diagnostics updated: `test_sandbox::test_dnsmasq_running` is
  replaced with `test_dns_proxy_running` plus a new
  `test_dnsmasq_not_running` that pins the cutover.
  `test_network` swaps the dnsmasq sentinel checks for two new
  acceptance tests: `test_dns_resolves_via_capsem_proxy` (a
  policy-allowed name resolves to a real IP, not the legacy
  10.0.0.1) and `test_dns_blocked_domain_returns_nxdomain` (the
  host policy short-circuits api.openai.com to NXDOMAIN before
  hitting the upstream resolver). Boot-stage marker added:
  `dns_proxy` between `net_proxy` and the rest of the boot
  sequence.

  End-to-end VM validation + `mitm-load` regression check still
  pending: the dev `capsem` binary needs codesigning (handled by
  the `just` recipes) and the `~/.capsem/assets/` install needs
  a `just install` to pick up the rebuilt initrd. Both fall
  under the junior-dev-owned bench runner this session, so the
  final acceptance gate is staged but not yet executed -- code,
  cross-compile, initrd repack (validated end-to-end via the
  Docker `agent` recipe), workspace clippy, and full Rust test
  suite are all green.

### Added (mitm-redesign T3.3)
- **`dns_events` telemetry table + per-query event row + trace_id
  correlation.** New `dns_events` schema in `capsem-logger`
  (timestamp, qname, qtype, qclass, rcode, decision, matched_rule,
  source_proto, process_name, upstream_resolver_ms, trace_id) with
  indexes on `(timestamp, qname, trace_id, decision)` for the
  inspect-session join. New `DnsEvent` event struct +
  `WriteOp::DnsEvent` + `insert_dns_event` writer; idempotent
  schema migration so existing DBs pick up the new table without a
  rebuild. New free function
  `capsem_core::net::dns::build_dns_event(result, source_proto,
  process_name, trace_id) -> DnsEvent` (pure, sqlite-free) +
  `serve_dns_session` in `capsem-process::vsock` calls it after
  every handler invocation and pushes the row through the shared
  `DbWriter` via `try_write` (matches the audit-event back-pressure
  pattern). `trace_id` is the ambient capsem trace id, so a single
  agent action joins across `dns_events` and `net_events` -- a
  `curl https://anthropic.com/` shows up as one `dns_events` row
  ("anthropic.com" allowed, qtype=A, rcode=0) plus one `net_events`
  row, both stamped with the same trace_id. 6 new
  capsem-core::net::dns::telemetry tests (allowed, denied,
  undecodable, decision strings round-trip with logger convention,
  source_proto optional, process_name passthrough) + 2 new
  capsem-logger writer tests (dns_event_insert_populates_row,
  dns_events_indexed_by_trace_id_for_join) + 3 new schema tests
  (create includes dns_events, migrate idempotent, indexes
  present). Bench gate still deferred to T3.4 (zero MITM hot-path
  code touched).

### Added (mitm-redesign T3.2)
- **vsock DNS envelope + guest `capsem-dns-proxy` listener.** New
  vsock port `VSOCK_PORT_DNS_PROXY = 5007` (`capsem-proto`)
  carries length-framed `rmp-serde` `DnsRequest` / `DnsResponse`
  envelopes between the guest agent and the host's `DnsHandler`.
  The host side (`capsem-process::vsock::serve_dns_session`)
  performs one envelope round-trip per vsock connection: read a
  `DnsRequest`, run `DnsHandler::handle` (T3.1), write a
  `DnsResponse`, close. The guest side is a new agent binary
  `capsem-dns-proxy` that listens on `127.0.0.1:1053` (UDP + TCP
  on the same port; iptables NAT will redirect 53 -> 1053 in
  T3.4) and opens a fresh vsock conn per query. The `DnsHandler`
  was retrofitted to take the same `Arc<RwLock<Arc<NetworkPolicy>>>`
  hot-swappable shape as `MitmProxyConfig` so an admin policy
  edit propagates to both protocols at once. The agent crate
  stays hickory-free -- it forwards raw bytes only. 9 new
  capsem-proto envelope tests (port-distinctness, request /
  response roundtrip, no-process-name path, compactness,
  garbage rejection, IPC-frame disjointness) + 5 new agent-bin
  unit tests pinning the listen port (1053), vsock port (5007),
  EDNS payload size, proto labels. Pre-T3.4 the `capsem-dns-proxy`
  binary is built and packaged but NOT launched -- T3.4 wires it
  into `capsem-init` alongside the iptables redirect for port 53
  and removes the dnsmasq invocation. Until then dnsmasq is still
  the guest's DNS server.

### Added (mitm-redesign T3.1)
- **Host-side DNS handler + UDP forwarder + wire-format parser.**
  New `capsem-core::net::dns` module (`server`, `resolver`) plus
  `capsem-core::net::parsers::dns_parser`. The `DnsHandler` is the
  bytes-in / bytes-out async processor that decodes a DNS query,
  consults the shared `NetworkPolicy::is_fully_blocked` rule, and
  either synthesizes an NXDOMAIN response (`Decision::Denied`),
  forwards the bytes verbatim to one of N upstream nameservers
  (default `1.1.1.1:53`, `8.8.8.8:53`; `Decision::Allowed`), or
  returns a synthetic SERVFAIL when every upstream is
  unreachable (`Decision::Error`). Read-only domains still
  resolve so the MITM proxy keeps its verb-level audit trail.
  Built on `hickory-proto = "0.26"` (workspace dep,
  `default-features = false, features = ["std"]`) -- the agent
  crate stays hickory-free; it'll forward raw bytes when T3.2
  wires the vsock envelope. 14 parser unit tests + 10 handler
  end-to-end tests against a fake `127.0.0.1:0` UDP upstream.
  Not yet wired into anything; T3.2 brings the vsock bridge,
  T3.3 the `dns_events` schema + telemetry hook, T3.4 cuts the
  guest image over from dnsmasq to iptables redirect.

### Performance (mcp-concurrency)
- **MCP gateway in-flight cap now scales with host CPU.** Default
  `DEFAULT_MCP_INFLIGHT` constant replaced with
  `default_inflight_cap()` = `available_parallelism * 4`. Anchors
  to the empirical sweet spot we measured on Apple M5 Max (18 cores,
  64 permits optimal) and tracks host shape automatically.
  `CAPSEM_MCP_INFLIGHT` continues to override the computed default.
  Sample mappings: 8-core -> 32, 16-core -> 64, 18-core (M5 Max) ->
  72, 32-core -> 128. Fallback when `available_parallelism()` itself
  fails: 8 cores -> 32 permits.
- **mcp-load throughput +62 % at concurrency 200; tail -24 %.**
  Three changes shipped together so the regression we measured when
  T1.2 + T1.3 were tried alone (p99@200: 40 → 358 ms, mitm rps -40 %)
  cannot land on its own again:
  1. **T1.2: aggregator subprocess pipelined.** `capsem-mcp-aggregator`
     no longer reads-then-handles-then-writes in one task; the reader
     spawns `handle_request` per incoming msgpack frame and a single
     writer task drains an `mpsc<AggregatorResponse>(256)` to stdout.
     `Shutdown` is acked synchronously on the reader path before the
     drain so we can't lose the ack to a stuck handler.
  2. **T1.3: hot manager lock eliminated.** `McpServerManager` now
     exposes `dispatch_call_tool` / `dispatch_read_resource` /
     `dispatch_get_prompt` that perform the lookup synchronously and
     return owned `impl Future + Send + 'static` futures. The
     aggregator wraps the manager in `std::sync::RwLock`; the sync
     read guard drops before the rmcp RPC is awaited, so concurrent
     dispatches never serialise on the manager.
  3. **T1.5: bounded concurrency at the gateway.** The MCP gateway in
     `capsem-core::mcp::gateway::serve_mcp_session` now acquires a
     `tokio::sync::Semaphore` permit BEFORE `tokio::spawn`-ing each
     handler. Default cap 64 (override via `CAPSEM_MCP_INFLIGHT`,
     forwarded through the capsem-service env-allowlist). Without
     this cap, T1.2 + T1.3 turn the MCP path into a CPU-starvation
     source for the rest of capsem-process (notably the MITM proxy on
     the same tokio runtime).
  Bench (Apple M5 Max, 2 vCPU bench VM, vs T1.1-only baseline at
  HEAD): mcp-load c=10 rps 3370 → 9160 (+172 %), c=50 rps 3081 →
  8633 (+180 %), c=200 rps 5224 → 8464 (+62 %), p99@200 57.1 →
  43.4 ms (-24 %), p999@200 67.9 → 53.4 ms (-21 %). mitm-load
  c=200 rps 2845 → 2968 (+4.3 %), p99 177 → 170 ms (-3.8 %) — both
  paths better, neither path regressed. Sprint MCP rps@200 gate
  (≥ 8000) cleared; the 35 ms p99@200 gate is still 8 ms over and
  is tracked as T3 in `sprints/mcp-concurrency/tracker.md`.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **T2 plain-HTTP coverage: adversarial / risk-shape tests.**
  Five more tests on top of the parsing-correctness ones, each
  hitting a real failure mode the proxy could plausibly meet in
  the wild:
    * `…body_larger_than_preview_cap_forwards_full_but_caps_preview`
      -- 16 KB request body (4x default `max_body_capture`).
      Asserts upstream receives the full body byte-for-byte,
      `NetEvent.bytes_sent == 16384`, but
      `NetEvent.request_body_preview` length <= 4096 and starts
      with the first 4 KB block (no later block leaked through
      the cap).
    * `…ipv6_host_header_does_not_silently_succeed` -- inbound
      `Host: [::1]:8080`. The host parser explicitly bails on
      `[`-prefixed hosts; the proxy must NOT 200 on the implicit
      ("", 80) fallback. Asserts response is 502 or 403, never
      200, with a non-Allowed `Decision`.
    * `…corrupted_gzip_response_doesnt_crash` -- upstream sends
      `Content-Encoding: gzip` plus a valid 10-byte gzip header
      followed by 61 bytes of garbage payload. With a 5s read
      deadline, the test asserts: (a) the proxy still emits
      exactly one `NetEvent` (= `on_response_end` fired = no
      panic on the response path), and (b) `bytes_received == 0`
      because `flate2::Decompress` yields nothing on a
      fully-corrupt deflate body. Future regressions that would
      leak pre-decode bytes here get caught.
    * `…truncated_upstream_response_doesnt_hang` -- upstream
      advertises `Content-Length: 1000` but writes only 33 bytes
      then closes. With a 5s read deadline. Asserts the proxy
      doesn't hang AND `bytes_received <= 33` AND `< 1000` (i.e.
      we record the actual bytes received, not the lying
      Content-Length).
    * `…zero_length_response_body_emits_netevent` -- 200 OK with
      `Content-Length: 0`. Asserts the chunk-hook chain still
      fires `on_response_end` on an empty body and emits exactly
      one `NetEvent` with `bytes_received == 0`.
  26 mitm_integration tests pass (17 plain-HTTP + 8 TLS + 1
  ignored throughput); 1542 lib tests pass; clippy clean.
- **T2 plain-HTTP coverage: verbs, query strings, header
  passthrough + secret redaction.** Four more integration tests
  on top of the structural ones, closing the parsing-correctness
  gap:
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_records_every_http_method` -- sends
      GET / HEAD / OPTIONS / POST / PUT / DELETE / PATCH on one
      keep-alive connection, asserts seven separate `NetEvent`
      rows each with the right `method` + `path` + `204` status.
      Validates verb parsing across both read-classified and
      write-classified methods.
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_records_query_string_with_parameters`
      -- `GET /search?q=hello%20world&page=2&filter=active&tag=a&tag=b`.
      Asserts the upstream sees the full request line verbatim
      AND `NetEvent.path == "/search"` (no `?`) +
      `NetEvent.query == "q=hello%20world&page=2&filter=active&tag=a&tag=b"`.
      Repeated keys, equals signs, and percent-encoded values
      preserved verbatim.
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_forwards_custom_headers_to_upstream`
      -- sends `User-Agent` (allowlisted), `X-Trace-Id`,
      `X-Custom-Flag`, `Authorization: Bearer ...` (custom).
      Asserts the upstream receives every header by name + value
      verbatim, and that `accept-encoding` was rewritten to `gzip`
      (we only forward what we can decompress).
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_telemetry_hashes_non_allowlisted_headers`
      -- security-focused. Sends real-shaped secrets:
      `Authorization: Bearer SUPER-SECRET-...`,
      `X-Api-Key: live_pk_DEADBEEF_...`,
      `Cookie: session=ROTATE_ME_...`. Asserts
      `NetEvent.request_headers` does NOT contain any of those
      verbatim values (each is replaced with `hash:<12-hex>`),
      while the header NAMES still appear and allowlisted
      `User-Agent` + `Host` appear verbatim. Locks down the
      "secrets in telemetry" surface.
  Also tightened the keep-alive test's response reader to drain
  head + body per request rather than relying on one-shot
  `tcp.read()` (was order-flaky on a busy CI). 21 mitm_integration
  tests pass; 1542 lib tests pass; clippy clean.
- **T2 plain-HTTP integration coverage extended.** Five new
  integration tests close the "ad-hoc verification" gap left by
  the earlier Ollama smoke. The new tests share a
  `spawn_fake_upstream(serve)` helper + a `read_http11_request`
  drainer so each test parameterizes the upstream's behavior:
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_post_forwards_body_and_records_bytes_sent`
      -- POST with body. Asserts the upstream sees the JSON body
      verbatim + `NetEvent.bytes_sent` covers the body.
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_chunked_streaming_response_aggregates_bytes`
      -- fake upstream sends `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` with 4
      data frames. Asserts the client sees every chunk +
      `NetEvent.bytes_received` equals the concatenated payload
      length (proves the ChunkDispatchBody runs the sync
      ChunkHook chain across multiple frames and the
      end-of-stream NetEvent emission fires).
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_keep_alive_emits_one_netevent_per_request`
      -- single client TCP connection, three back-to-back GETs to
      `/a`, `/b`, `/c`. Asserts three separate `NetEvent` rows,
      each with the right path/method/status/port/conn_type.
      Validates the per-connection cached upstream sender +
      keep-alive on the plain-HTTP branch.
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_preserves_host_header_to_upstream`
      -- captures the bytes the upstream observed. Asserts the
      inbound `Host: 127.0.0.1:<port>` header is forwarded
      verbatim. (TLS path rewrites Host from SNI; HTTP must not.)
    * `mitm_proxy_plain_http_unresolvable_upstream_emits_502_netevent`
      -- targets `nonexistent.invalid` (RFC 6761). Asserts 502
      back to the client + one `NetEvent` with `Decision::Error`,
      status 502, conn_type http-mitm, and the dial error in
      `matched_rule`. No silent drop on dial failure.
  17 mitm_integration tests pass (8 plain-HTTP + 8 TLS + 1
  ignored throughput); 1542 lib tests pass; clippy clean.
- **T2 verified end-to-end against real Ollama on
  `127.0.0.1:11434`.** From inside an air-gapped VM, `curl
  http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags` rides the full new pipeline:
  iptables redirect (port 11434 → 10080), agent listener on
  10080, vsock bridge, host first-byte sniff (T2.1), Host header
  parse + port allowlist (T2.2), plain TCP upstream dial, 357-byte
  JSON response forwarded verbatim to the guest. NetEvent recorded
  with `port=11434, conn_type=http-mitm, decision=allowed,
  status=200`. As part of the verification,
  `DEFAULT_HTTP_UPSTREAM_PORTS` is bumped from `[80]` to
  `[80, 3128, 3713, 8080, 11434]` so the host policy default mirrors the iptables
  rules in `capsem-init` -- otherwise port 11434 traffic gets
  redirected to 10080, hits the host proxy, and is rejected by
  the policy gate, which is the wrong default for the canonical
  local-LLM workflow this protocol path was designed for. New
  ports get added by editing the shared policy config and guest redirect lists
  in tandem.
- **T2 (agent-side): plain-HTTP listener + iptables redirects.**
  `capsem-net-proxy` now listens on `127.0.0.1:10080` in addition to
  the original `:10443`; a `run_listener(port)` helper drives the
  per-port accept loop, and both targets the same vsock port
  `VSOCK_PORT_SNI_PROXY` (5002) -- the host's first-byte sniff
  (T2.1) classifies on wire bytes, so the guest-side listener split
  is just an iptables-target convenience. `capsem-init` adds two
  `iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport <N> -j REDIRECT
  --to-port 10080` rules for `:80` (plain HTTP) and `:11434`
  (Ollama default); the post-launch readiness poll waits for both
  `:10443` and `:10080` before declaring the proxy ready. Three
  new in-VM diagnostics cover the wiring:
  `test_iptables_redirect_80_to_10080`,
  `test_iptables_redirect_11434_to_10080`, and
  `test_net_proxy_http_listening`. Three new agent unit tests pin
  the new constant + cross-port distinctness. Cross-compile
  (`aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`) clean. The configurable
  guest-side allowlist (read from `policy_config`) is deferred --
  the host-side `NetworkPolicy.http_upstream_ports` is the
  authoritative gate, and adding a config plumb to the guest-side
  iptables list is its own follow-up.
- **T2.3: Ollama-shaped end-to-end test for the plain-HTTP path.**
  `mitm_proxy_plain_http_ollama_shape_records_telemetry` spins a
  fake plain-HTTP upstream on `127.0.0.1:0`, configures the proxy
  with that OS-assigned port on its `http_upstream_ports` allowlist
  + `127.0.0.1` on the domain allowlist, sends `POST /api/generate`
  with the typical Ollama request shape (model + prompt JSON body),
  and asserts: (a) the upstream's response body is forwarded
  verbatim, (b) the resulting `NetEvent` records
  `method=POST`, `path=/api/generate`, `status=200`,
  `domain=127.0.0.1`, `port=<upstream_port>`,
  `conn_type=http-mitm`, `decision=Allowed`, with non-zero
  `bytes_sent` / `bytes_received`. Adds `make_proxy_config_full`
  helper to override the `http_upstream_ports` allowlist
  (existing tests stay on the default `[80]`). 12 mitm_integration
  tests pass.
- **T2.2 (host-side): plain HTTP serves through the same hyper
  pipeline as TLS.** When the first-byte sniff (T2.1) classifies a
  connection as `Protocol::Http`, the listener now skips rustls
  entirely and runs `hyper::server::conn::http1::Builder::new()
  .serve_connection(io, svc)` directly on the vsock stream
  (`ReplayReader` carries the buffered first bytes). Per-request
  domain + upstream port are parsed from the inbound `Host` header
  by `parse_http_host_target` (T2.2 helper in `mitm_proxy/util.rs`)
  and threaded through `handle_request` as a new `upstream_port:
  u16` parameter; the inbound `host` header is preserved (it's
  authoritative for plain HTTP), unlike the TLS path which still
  rewrites it from the SNI domain. The hyper service closure runs
  the same PolicyHook and ChunkHook chain as TLS, so domain
  policy, decompression, SSE parsing, AI interpreters and
  Telemetry all apply uniformly. Upstream dials branch on
  `protocol`: TLS does TCP+rustls+http1::handshake, HTTP does
  TCP+http1::handshake (no TLS step). Telemetry: every
  `TelemetryRequestContext` carries `port: u16` + `conn_type:
  &'static str` (`https-mitm` / `http-mitm`); `NetEvent` rows now
  reflect the actual upstream port and transport label so
  operators can split HTTPS vs plain-HTTP traffic in `session.db`.
  `MitmProxyConfig::handle_inner` is split into `serve_tls`,
  `serve_plain_http`, and a shared `serve_pipeline` helper that
  drives the hyper server over either an `IO: hyper::rt::Read +
  hyper::rt::Write`. New `NetworkPolicy::http_upstream_ports:
  Vec<u16>` (default `[80]`) gates plain-HTTP upstream ports
  before the dial -- a request whose `Host` header carries an
  allowlist-missing port is rejected with a 403 + Decision::Denied
  + `matched_rule = "http-port-not-allowlisted({port})"`. The TLS
  path is unaffected by the allowlist (always uses 443).
  Two new integration tests cover the path:
  `mitm_proxy_plain_http_denies_disallowed_host` (PolicyHook 403
  on a disallowed Host) and
  `mitm_proxy_plain_http_denies_port_not_in_allowlist` (port-gate
  403). 1539 lib tests + 11 mitm_integration tests pass; clippy
  clean. Agent-side multi-port listener and iptables rules ship
  separately so the in-VM test (T2.3) can drive them.
- **T2.1: first-byte protocol sniff (TLS vs plain HTTP) on the vsock
  listener.** New `mitm_proxy::protocol` module with `Protocol` enum
  (`Tls` / `Http` / `Unknown`) and `detect(&[u8]) -> Option<Protocol>`
  classifier. The `vsock:5002` accept path now peeks the first
  post-meta payload byte: `0x16` -> TLS (existing path, unchanged);
  uppercase ASCII (`0x41..=0x5A`, the HTTP method set) -> plain HTTP
  classified but routed to a "T2.2-pending" connection-level error
  (the actual hyper plain-HTTP server lands in T2.2); other bytes ->
  `Unknown` connection-level error. The `mitm.connections_total`
  counter, previously hard-coded to `protocol="tls"` on every accept,
  is now incremented post-sniff with the correct label so operators
  can distinguish TLS / HTTP / unknown traffic. `mitm.requests_total`
  + the upstream-error increments propagate the same label.
  `ConnMeta` carries a `protocol: Protocol` field set from the sniff;
  every hook reads it through `ctx.conn().protocol`. 8 unit tests in
  `protocol/tests.rs` cover the byte-level rules (record types
  `0x14`/`0x15`/`0x17` rejected; lowercase methods rejected; high-bit
  junk rejected) plus 2 integration tests in `mitm_integration.rs`
  asserting the plain-HTTP and unknown-byte paths each emit the
  right `NetEvent`.

### Changed (mitm-redesign)
- **T1 closes -- legacy async body chain deleted; sync ChunkHook
  pipeline owns the response path end-to-end.** Slice 9 cleanup.
  Removes `mitm_proxy/telemetry.rs` (`TelemetryEmitter` +
  `TelemetryBody`, ~390 lines), `ai_traffic/ai_body.rs`
  (`AiResponseBody`, ~155 lines), `body::DecompressBody` +
  `body::BodyStream` + `body::RespStatsKind` (one
  `async_compression::tokio::bufread::GzipDecoder` adapter, one
  `tokio_util::io::StreamReader`, one `Body→Stream` shim). The
  inline `if is_gzip { DecompressBody::new(...) }` block in
  `handle_request` is gone -- the inline `if is_gzip` now only
  strips Content-Encoding / Content-Length headers (a few field
  accesses on the parts struct, kept inline because moving it to
  an async hook would re-introduce the same plumbing the slice
  removed). All four ChunkHooks are pure sync: `DecompressionHook`
  (`flate2::Decompress::new(false)`), `SseParserHook`, three
  `InterpreterHook`s, `TelemetryHook` -- per-chunk work runs inline
  from `poll_frame` with no `.await`, no channel hop, no async
  wrapper. `TelemetryHook` is wired into
  `make_production_pipeline` + reads its per-request context out
  of a `HookState` slot seeded by `handle_request` (new
  `HookState::set::<T>()` + `ChunkDispatchBody::seed::<T>()`
  builder). `MitmProxyConfig` is refactored to hold
  `Arc<TelemetryDeps> { db, pricing, trace_state }` instead of
  by-value `pricing` + `Mutex<TraceState>` -- the `Arc` breaks
  the would-be config↔pipeline↔hook reference cycle (the hook
  points at `TelemetryDeps`, not the surrounding config).
  `make_production_pipeline` signature now takes the
  `Arc<TelemetryDeps>`; `capsem-process` construction site +
  in-tree test fixtures + the integration test in
  `crates/capsem-core/tests/mitm_integration.rs` updated. The
  redundant `TelemetryEmitter` / `TelemetryBody` / `DecompressBody`
  / `emit_model_call` / `trace_chains_across_tool_use` test
  fixtures in `mitm_proxy/tests.rs` are deleted -- the same
  surfaces are covered by the per-hook tests in
  `telemetry_hook/tests.rs` (NetEvent + ModelCall builders),
  `decompression_hook/tests.rs` (gzip streaming), and the
  remaining integration tests still exercise the full path
  end-to-end via `handle_connection`.

  **Bench: SSE parser microbench at 478-488 MiB/s (up from 449-472
  MiB/s in the T0 pre-rewrite baseline; criterion reports
  "Performance has improved" with p<0.05).** Sync ChunkHooks are
  structurally faster than the async wrappers they replace.
  `capsem-bench mitm-load` against
  `benchmarks/baselines/mitm-load/baseline.json` is the integration gate;
  it requires a built VM image and is run on a real-machine
  session (this commit's verification rests on the criterion
  micro-bench + the 8 in-tree integration tests through the
  full MITM path).

  1531 capsem-core lib tests pass (down from 1547 -- the deleted
  redundant fixtures); 8/8 mitm_integration tests pass; clippy
  clean.

### Performance (mcp)
- **Pipelined the MCP gateway loop**
  (`crates/capsem-core/src/mcp/gateway.rs`). The per-vsock-connection
  serial `read → handle → write` loop is replaced with a reader that
  spawns one `tokio::spawn(handle_json_rpc)` per request and a
  dedicated writer task that drains an `mpsc::Receiver<Vec<u8>>`(256).
  Out-of-order responses are fine — JSON-RPC `id` lets the client
  demux. mcp-load (single fastmcp Client over one vsock) gains
  **+30 % rps@200 (4 252 → 5 551) and -44 % p99@200 (70.95 → 39.73 ms)**;
  mitm-load unchanged (±2.6 %). Next ceiling is the aggregator
  subprocess loop (T1.2 in `sprints/mcp-concurrency/`).

### Fixed (mcp)
- **`capsem_host_logs` / `capsem_panics` / `capsem_triage` /
  `capsem_timeline` no longer corrupt query values with reserved
  characters.** Each tool built its URL via raw
  `format!("k={}&", value)` interpolation. Two failure modes,
  both reproduced via live MCP:
  1. Any value containing whitespace (e.g. `grep="capsem-gateway
     spawned"`) failed with `invalid uri character` because the
     URL parser rejects unencoded spaces. **Multi-word grep was
     completely broken.**
  2. Any value containing `&` (e.g. `grep="foo&bar"`) was silently
     truncated to `foo` because the server's query parser saw the
     unescaped `&` as a separator and treated `bar` as a stray
     empty param.
  Same risk on `=`, `+`, `#`, `%`, `?`, and other reserved chars
  in `since`, `id`, `trace_id`, `layers`. Fix in
  `crates/capsem-mcp/src/main.rs`: new `query_string` helper
  builds the query from a list of `(key, Option<value>)` pairs,
  percent-encoding each value with an explicit RFC 3986
  query-value set (CONTROLS plus all reserved/unsafe ASCII;
  ALPHA/DIGIT and the unreserved `-._~` round-trip plain).
  Refactored the 4 tools to use it; trailing-`&` cosmetic issue
  fixed as a side effect. 8 new unit tests cover empty/single/
  multiple/None-skipping/space/`&`/multi-reserved-chars/unreserved-
  passthrough. `capsem_service_logs` was unaffected (does
  client-side filtering); the other 21 tools use JSON bodies or
  path-only URLs and don't take untrusted query values.

### Fixed (build)
- **`just _pack-initrd` no longer corrupts the hash-named hardlink
  while a stress run is mid-`VmConfig::build`.** The recipe wrote
  the gzipped cpio archive via shell redirect (`gzip > "$INITRD"`),
  which truncates the existing inode in place. `create_hash_assets.py`
  later gives `initrd.img` a hash-named hardlink (e.g.
  `initrd-<hex16>.img`, sharing the inode). An in-place rewrite
  mutates that hardlink's content too, so any concurrent VM mid-
  `VmConfig::build` reading the old hash-named path computes a hash
  of the NEW bytes and rejects with `hash mismatch for ...img:
  expected X, got Y` -- a stress run hit by a parallel `just
  _pack-initrd` lost two cycles per race (observed in
  `target/stress-acceptance-logs/iter-6.log` cycles 48-49 with
  unified-log evidence of `cpio` running at the exact failure
  timestamp). Fix in `Justfile`: write to `${INITRD}.tmp.$$` and
  `mv` to the final path. The atomic rename leaves the old inode
  (and its hash-named hardlink) intact until `_cleanup_stale` in
  `create_hash_assets.py` explicitly unlinks the old alias.

### Fixed (resume,protocol)
- **Stress-cycle "doesn't have entitlement" cascade now self-recovers
  via launchd-cleanup-aware retry.** Apple's
  `Virtualization.framework` runs a per-VM XPC helper
  (`com.apple.Virtualization.VirtualMachine.<UUID>`); when
  capsem-process dies, launchd schedules that XPC's cleanup with a
  9-second delay (observed in `log show`: `scheduling cleanup in 9
  sec after sending Killed: 9` followed by `internal event:
  PETRIFIED`). Under rapid VM churn (~3s/cycle) the cleanup queue
  grows; once `syspolicyd` saturates (`Unable to get certificates
  array: (null)` in the unified log just before the failure
  window), the next freshly-spawned capsem-process's
  `VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.validateWithError()` returns
  NSError code 2 with the misleading
  `localizedDescription = "...The process doesn't have the
  'com.apple.security.virtualization' entitlement."` -- even though
  the binary IS entitled. We saw this fire as 2-cycle cascades at
  ~cycle 37-40 of the 50-cycle stress (iter-2 cycles 37-38; iter-6
  cycles 39-40 post-Bug-C-fix). Two-part fix in
  `crates/capsem-service/src/main.rs`:
  (1) New `is_launchd_cleanup_transient` helper pattern-matches
  the full VZ-specific phrase (`com.apple.security.virtualization`
  + `entitlement`) on the failed-attempt's process.log tail. Does
  NOT match a bare `entitlement` mention so a real codesign
  regression still surfaces.
  (2) `handle_provision` extracts the per-attempt logic into
  `provision_attempt` and wraps it in `capsem_core::poll::poll_until`
  with `timeout=8s, initial_delay=200ms, max_delay=500ms`. On
  `LaunchdTransient` outcome the loop unregisters the failed
  attempt's persistent-registry entry + clears the instances map,
  then retries; everything else (`BootCrash`, `ProvisionError`,
  `Ready`) bails or succeeds immediately. Retry-decision routing
  is a pure function (`classify_attempt_decision`) so the retry
  logic is unit-testable without spawning a real VM. Worst-case
  user-visible latency on a healthy launchd is unchanged
  (single attempt, ~3-5s); under cascade the retry adds ~500ms-1s
  of backoff per failed attempt, amortized against the launchd
  drain. Unit coverage: 4 matcher tests + 6 routing tests covering
  Ready/StillBooting/LaunchdTransient/BootCrash/already-exists
  /generic-provision-error.
- **Post-resume `vsock_connect` ECONNRESET no longer poisons the agent's
  exec dedup cache.** After `restoreMachineStateFromURL` the host's
  vsock listener for the EXEC port (5005) is registered but the
  kernel-side accept queue can briefly reset incoming connections
  while VZ attaches it. The agent's `run_exec` opened that connection
  with a single-shot `vsock_connect`; one ECONNRESET → `run_exec`
  returned 126 → `exec_done` cached `id → 126` → every host-watchdog
  retry of the same Exec id replayed `ExecDone {exit_code: 126}`,
  even after the transport recovered. Captured in serial.log as
  `exec[N] vsock connect failed: Connection reset by peer (os error
  104)` followed by `exec[N] duplicate (already done, exit=126);
  replaying ExecDone`. Two-part fix in
  `crates/capsem-agent/src/main.rs`: (1) new
  `vsock_connect_with_econnreset_retry` helper retries on
  `ErrorKind::ConnectionReset` only (5 attempts × 20ms backoff =
  ~100ms ceiling, well under the host's 1s watchdog window);
  non-ECONNRESET errors bail immediately so misconfiguration
  (refused / address-family-unsupported) is not papered over. (2)
  `run_exec` now returns `ExecOutcome::{Done(i32), TransportFailed}`;
  `control_loop` only inserts into `exec_done` when
  `outcome.should_cache()` -- transport failures stay uncached so
  the next host-watchdog retry gets a fresh attempt against the
  recovered vsock. The host still receives `ExecDone {exit_code:
  126}` so its watchdog resolves with a real ExecResult instead of
  hanging. Verified in real-VM stress: pre-fix cycle 1 hit this in
  the very first failure; post-fix 39 consecutive cycles pass before
  a different (separately-tracked) failure mode appears. Unit
  coverage: 7 new tests covering retry-success, retry-recovery,
  bail-on-other-kinds, exhaustion, cache-decision matrix.
- **Symmetric guest-side replay buffer with `HostToGuest::AckReply`.**
  Closes the bidirectional silent-drop hole: the prior bridge replay
  layer covered the host→guest forward path; this adds the matching
  guest→host return path. The agent now keeps every ackable
  `GuestToHost` response (`ExecDone` / `FileOpDone` / `FileContent` /
  `Error`) in a `pending_responses` map keyed by `id`, lifted to
  outer scope in `capsem-agent/src/main.rs` so it survives
  reconnects (the writer thread is per-`run_bridge`). On every
  fresh control conn the writer thread first replays every entry
  still in the map, then resumes normal writes. The host bridge in
  `capsem-process/src/vsock.rs` emits `HostToGuest::AckReply { id }`
  immediately on receipt of an ackable response; `control_loop`
  removes the entry. Without this, an ExecDone (or FileContent --
  worse, since the agent doesn't cache file bytes) lost on the
  Apple VZ silent-drop path was unrecoverable except via the
  host's watchdog re-sending the original `Exec`, which only worked
  for `Exec` (cached `exit_code`) and not for `FileRead`'s
  `FileContent`. Verified directionally with a 50-cycle
  `CAPSEM_STRESS=1 test_stress_suspend_resume.py` run, 50/50 passed.
- **Bridge replay layer with `GuestToHost::Ack` for ackable
  HostToGuest messages.** The control bridge in
  `capsem-process/src/vsock.rs` now keeps every ackable outbound
  message (`Exec` / `FileWrite` / `FileRead` / `FileDelete`) in a
  pending map keyed by `id` (`JobStore::pending_acks`). The agent
  emits `GuestToHost::Ack { id }` immediately on receipt, *before*
  any processing -- the bridge clears the entry. On every fresh
  control conn after a re-key, the bridge re-writes every entry
  still in the map. This is the protocol-level cover for Apple
  VZ's post-restoreState silent-drop pattern: the host's
  `write_control_msg` returns success while the bytes never
  propagate, so the previous single-slot `held: Option<HostToGuest>`
  (which only fired on write *errors*) couldn't catch them. The
  multi-slot map also recovers a message whose Ack was lost on the
  return path -- the message stays pending across reconnects until
  an ack actually lands. Agent dedup ensures a re-sent message that
  did land twice doesn't double-execute.
- **Watchdog recalibrated to 1s × 16 retries (16s budget)** -- with
  the bridge replay layer now handling forward-path losses, the
  watchdog only exists to cover the asymmetric return-path case
  (agent processed and sent ExecDone / FileOpDone, those bytes were
  silently dropped). 1s gives ~6× headroom over the longest
  observed healthy round-trip (~150ms for `bash -c "mkdir+echo+cat"`)
  without sitting idle for 3s of dead time.
- The earlier "8 × 3s = 24s budget" config (commit `8cc76e2`) is
  superseded -- the storm-derivation-based number was correct in
  intent but the bridge replay layer is the structurally right fix
  for forward-path drops.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`TelemetryHook` -- per-request `NetEvent` + optional `ModelCall`
  emission as a sync `ChunkHook`.** T1 slice 8 (additive). Carries
  the entire emit surface that lives in `telemetry::TelemetryEmitter`
  today, packaged as a `ChunkHook` that fires on `on_response_end`.
  The hook owns its own response-side byte counting + preview, so
  once the legacy chain is removed in the cleanup slice it
  replaces both `TelemetryEmitter` (the per-request scratch
  struct) and `TelemetryBody` (the body wrapper that decided
  *when* to fire). Per-request context is read out of a typed
  `HookState` slot (`Option<TelemetryRequestContext>`); a missing
  slot puts the hook in shadow mode (no allocation, no emit). The
  per-call `LlmEventStream` populated by the interpreter hooks is
  read at end-of-stream and folded into the `ModelCall` via the
  existing `collect_summary` path. Pure builder helpers
  (`build_net_event` and `maybe_build_model_call`) are split out
  so tests verify the field-mapping logic without spinning up an
  async runtime or a real `DbWriter`. Trace-correlation
  (tool-use chains across requests) goes through a shared
  `Arc<Mutex<TraceState>>` exactly the way `TelemetryEmitter`
  does today, so existing trace-grouping behavior is preserved
  byte-for-byte. Hook is **not** yet registered in
  `make_production_pipeline` and `handle_request` is **not** yet
  rewired; those changes ship together with the deletion of
  `telemetry.rs`, the legacy `AiResponseBody` /
  `DecompressBody` wrappers, and the benchmark gate in slice 9
  cleanup. Eight unit tests covering: `NetEvent` field mapping,
  HEAD probe filter, non-LLM path filter, non-AI provider
  filter, `LlmEvent` flow into `ModelCall`, tool-use trace
  chaining across two requests, shadow-mode skip when context
  unseeded, byte counting + preview tally with seeded context.
  1547 capsem-core lib tests pass; clippy clean.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`DecompressionHook` -- streaming gzip decompression as a sync
  `ChunkHook`.** T1 slice 7. Replaces the
  `async_compression::tokio::bufread::GzipDecoder` driving
  `body::DecompressBody` with the lower-level
  `flate2::Decompress` raw-deflate state machine plus a small
  hand-rolled gzip-header parser. gzip streaming-decode is
  fundamentally sync, so the async wrapper was plumbing-only
  (one `tokio::io::AsyncRead` adapter, one `StreamReader`, one
  `Body -> Stream` shim) -- removing it is the goal of the cleanup
  slice. The hook detects gzip from the first two bytes' magic
  prefix (`0x1f 0x8b`) since the per-request `HookState` slot map
  carried by `ChunkDispatchBody` isn't shared with async
  `Hook::on_event`'s state, so a `Content-Encoding: gzip` flag
  can't bridge from `RawResponseHead` into the chunk pass through
  that map. Magic detection sidesteps the issue without changing
  the hook trait. The header parser handles the standard 10-byte
  prefix plus FEXTRA / FNAME / FCOMMENT / FHCRC optional fields
  (RFC 1952 §2.3.1). After the header, the deflate body streams
  through `flate2::Decompress::new(false)` (`zlib_header=false` =
  raw deflate); the decoder retains state across chunks so partial
  blocks split anywhere decode correctly. Registered in
  `make_production_pipeline` BEFORE the SSE parser hook so the
  hook order is correct once the legacy inline `DecompressBody` is
  removed in slice 9 (today the hook is essentially a no-op
  because `DecompressBody` decompresses upstream of the
  `ChunkDispatchBody` and the hook sees plaintext bytes; that's
  intentional -- this slice ships the surface, the cleanup slice
  flips the switch). Six unit tests: single-chunk decompress,
  decompressed-bytes split across two chunks, plain non-gzip
  passthrough, classification stickiness (a chunk that happens to
  start with `0x1f 0x8b` after a non-gzip first chunk is left
  alone), byte-by-byte chunking, and one-byte-first-chunk
  classification deferred. 1539 capsem-core lib tests pass;
  clippy clean.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Provider interpreter `ChunkHook`s -- Anthropic / OpenAI /
  Google.** T1 slice 6. Three concrete `ChunkHook`s that consume
  parsed `SseEvent`s from the upstream `SseEventStream` slot and
  emit provider-agnostic `LlmEvent`s into a shared `LlmEventStream`
  slot. Each interpreter gates on its provider's domain
  (`api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`,
  `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) so registering all three in
  the production pipeline is essentially free for non-AI traffic --
  the unmatched hooks short-circuit on a single string compare
  before touching state. Internally, each hook reuses the existing
  `ProviderStreamParser` impl
  (`AnthropicStreamParserWithState` / `OpenAiStreamParser` /
  `GoogleStreamParser`) -- no parsing logic is duplicated, so all
  the existing per-provider tests still cover the parse semantics.
  The interpreter takes the parser out of its slot via
  `mem::take`, drains `SseEventStream`, runs each event through
  the parser, then puts the parser back -- this releases the slot
  map for the SSE/LLM slot accesses inside (single-borrow at a
  time on the slot map). `LlmEventStream` carries an optional
  `provider: ProviderKind` set by the matching interpreter on
  first push, so downstream consumers can dispatch on provider
  without re-parsing the domain. `on_response_end` runs the same
  drain so trailing SSE events flushed by `SseParserHook` reach
  the interpreter. All three registered in
  `make_production_pipeline` after `SseParserHook`. Six unit tests
  covering: end-to-end Anthropic SSE → text delta + summary,
  OpenAI text delta, Google multi-part chunk, three-hooks-coexist
  routing (only matching one drains), wrong-domain skip leaves
  queue untouched, on_response_end trailing flush. 1533
  capsem-core lib tests pass; clippy clean.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`SseParserHook` -- the first concrete `ChunkHook` consumer.** T1
  slice 5. Wraps the existing `parsers::sse_parser::SseParser` as a
  sync `ChunkHook` and writes parsed `SseEvent`s into a public
  per-request `SseEventStream` slot via `ChunkCtx::state`. The slot
  is the bridge to the provider-specific interpreter hooks landing
  in the next slice -- they drain new events on every chunk pass to
  build `ModelCall` summaries. The hook gates internally on AI
  domains (`api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`,
  `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) so registering it in the
  production pipeline is free for non-AI traffic: the `is_ai` check
  caches in the parser-state slot on first chunk and a non-AI
  connection bails before allocating the parser. `on_response_end`
  flushes any trailing event without a terminating blank line --
  matches the behavior of the inline `AiResponseBody` path that
  this hook is replacing. Now registered in
  `make_production_pipeline`. Six unit tests cover single-chunk,
  multi-chunk-split, multi-event accumulation, non-AI bypass,
  trailing-event flush, and the `[DONE]` sentinel filter for
  OpenAI. 1527 capsem-core lib tests pass; clippy clean.

### Fixed (resume,protocol)
- **Host-side watchdog around HostToGuest::Exec / FileWrite / FileRead
  with j_rx-based retry and 24s budget.** Apple VZ post-restoreState
  occasionally drops a successfully-written vsock frame (the host's
  `write_control_msg` returns success; the bytes never reach the
  guest), and the existing single-slot replay buffer in the control
  bridge can't catch this -- it only triggers on a write *error*.
  The watchdog re-sends the payload every 3s if the host hasn't seen
  the result oneshot resolve. Direct measurement of one stress-suite
  failure (`process.log` from
  `20260503-220608/.../susp-10f1a6c7`) showed the storm lasted 9.13s
  before any message arrived end-to-end, so the budget is set to 8
  attempts × 3s = 24s, leaving 6s of headroom under the 30s IPC
  envelope. The watchdog's signal is the j_rx oneshot resolving
  (i.e. ExecResult / FileOp ack), not ExecStarted -- the latter
  fires while ExecDone is still in flight, and ExecDone can be lost
  on the same torn return path the original Exec was lost on.
- **Agent-side dedup with cached ExecDone replay.** Exec ids
  observed during a session are tracked in two maps shared across
  reconnects: `exec_inflight` (still running -- skip duplicate, the
  original will send ExecDone) and `exec_done: HashMap<id,
  exit_code>` (finished -- replay GuestToHost::ExecDone with the
  cached code so the host's j_rx resolves even when the original
  reply was lost on the return path). The maps are hoisted out of
  `control_loop` into the parent's outer reconnect scope so a retry
  that lands on a *new* control conn after the previous one was
  torn still hits the dedup logic. File ops are intentionally not
  deduped -- write/read/delete are idempotent enough to re-process
  and re-ack on every receipt, which is correct for a FileOpDone
  that was lost on the return path (dedup-with-skip there would
  deadlock the host watchdog).

### Known limitations (resume,protocol)
- **Stress-suite flakiness floor: ~30% iteration fail rate remains.**
  10x runs of the back-to-back stress suite
  (`test_svc_resume_paths.py` + `test_svc_suspend_corruption.py` +
  `TestSuspendResume`) score 6-7/10 with these fixes, vs 7/10 for
  the unfixed baseline at HEAD~1 -- within the same noise band.
  Direct measurement (one ovl-test failure) showed the post-resume
  storm can last 21s of constant vsock re-keying, dropping
  bidirectional traffic for the entire window. Neither host-side
  retries nor guest-side response replay survive a storm that
  spans the whole 30s IPC envelope, because the bytes for the
  retried Exec *and* its replayed ExecDone are both subject to
  silent-drop on every conn. Closing this requires either: (a)
  application-level reliability (per-message ACKs over vsock with
  exponential backoff and a longer envelope), (b) a guest-side
  replay buffer for GuestToHost messages analogous to the host's
  bridge replay buffer (held across the agent's reconnect rather
  than dropped when the writer thread breaks), or (c) detecting and
  pausing sends during a storm. Followup beyond this sprint's scope.

### Fixed (test-infra)
- **`/delete` now routes through `preserve_failed_session_dir`.**
  Previously the only paths that preserved `process.log` /
  `serial.log` / `session.db` for post-mortem were three
  host-detected failure routes; a Python-side test assertion that
  fired after `/exec` but before the test's `finally:
  client.delete()` left only `service.log` archived, which doesn't
  show what the per-VM process or the guest were doing. The cull
  is bumped from 5 to 32 most-recent failed sessions so a
  10-iteration stress run that creates 1-3 VMs per iteration
  doesn't lose earlier failures to the LRU. Disk usage stays
  bounded by the cull regardless.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Pipeline observability contract: every hook call is logged,
  timed, and counted.** Closes the "what is blocking?" gap. Async
  `Hook::on_event` is now wrapped in a `mitm.hook` info-span carrying
  fields `hook`, `kind`, `layer`, `decision` (recorded after the
  future resolves -- one of `continue`/`rewrote`/`stop_drop`/
  `stop_reject`/`stop_dns_reject`), and `duration_ms`. Counter
  `mitm.hook_invocations_total{hook}` increments per call;
  histogram `mitm.hook_duration_ms{hook}` samples the wall time.
  Trace events bracket the call: `on_enter` + `on_exit` at trace!
  level (filter via `RUST_LOG=mitm.hook=trace`). Stop-outcomes
  promote to debug! at target `mitm.hook.cause` so triage tooling
  surfaces them at default RUST_LOG=info filtering. Sync
  `ChunkHook` iteration gets the same counter + histogram (no span,
  trace! events at `mitm.hook.chunk` -- per-chunk spans would
  dominate the bench budget). New unit test installs a
  `metrics_util::DebuggingRecorder` via `set_default_local_recorder`
  and asserts the counter + histogram both fire on a single
  dispatch. 1521 tests pass; clippy clean.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`ChunkHook` -- sync per-body-chunk hook trait + pipeline
  registration.** T1 slice 3 foundation. `ChunkHook` is a sync
  companion to the async `Hook` trait: methods
  `on_request_chunk(&mut Bytes, &mut ChunkCtx)` /
  `on_response_chunk(...)` / `on_request_end` /
  `on_response_end`. Body wrappers iterate registered ChunkHooks
  inline from `poll_frame` -- no async overhead, no channel hop.
  Sync is correct here because per-chunk work is fundamentally
  CPU-bound byte transformation: decompression, regex
  match-and-replace, streaming parsers, byte counting. None need
  `.await`. Per-connection state lives in the same typed slot
  map the async `Hook`s use, accessed via `ChunkCtx::state::<T>()`.
  `Pipeline` gains `register_chunk(ArcChunkHook)` builder method,
  `has_chunk_hooks()` short-circuit predicate, and
  `dispatch_request_chunk` / `dispatch_response_chunk` /
  `dispatch_request_end` / `dispatch_response_end` iteration
  helpers. Two new unit tests prove the surface: registration-order
  iteration with one hook rewriting bytes that the next hook then
  observes, and the empty-pipeline short-circuit. Slices 3b
  (DecompressionHook), 3c (TelemetryHook), 3d (SseParserHook) are
  now unblocked. 1520 tests pass; clippy clean.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`RawResponseHead` dispatch + per-request `mitm.request` span.**
  T1 slice 3a (observer surface). After upstream returns headers,
  `handle_request` now dispatches `Event::RawResponseHead(&mut parts)`
  through the pipeline so future hooks can observe the response head
  before any wrapping (decompression, telemetry, AI parsing) takes
  place. Hooks that want to react to status codes or content-encoding
  / content-type live here. Today observer-only -- the Stop outcome
  is intentionally dropped because handing the upstream sender
  partially-used would leak. Plus a `#[instrument(target="mitm.request")]`
  decoration on `handle_request` itself recording fields domain,
  method, path, decision, status; every log line in a request now
  carries those as structured fields. Pure addition; no behavior
  change. 1518 tests pass; clippy clean.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Metrics + tracing decision contract wired on the hot path.** T1
  slice 4. Every TLS connection now increments
  `mitm.connections_total{protocol="tls"}` and the
  `mitm.active_connections` gauge (RAII-decremented on drop, even on
  panic). Every request increments
  `mitm.requests_total{protocol="tls", decision}` partitioned by
  outcome (`allow` / `deny` / `upstream_error`). TLS handshake time
  histograms via `mitm.tls_handshake_ms`; full upstream-dial path
  (TCP + TLS) via `mitm.upstream_dial_ms`. `handle_connection` now
  in a `#[instrument(target="mitm.connection")]` span. No recorder
  registered yet, so each emission is one relaxed atomic add against
  the global no-op recorder (~4 ns per call per the T0 baseline).
  Two new smoke tests assert the metric names are unique and
  `describe_all` is idempotent. 1518 capsem-core lib tests pass;
  clippy clean.

### Fixed (virtio-blk-overlay-migration)
- **System overlay moved off loop-on-VirtioFS onto a real virtio-blk
  device.** rootfs.img is now attached to the guest as `/dev/vdb` and
  mounted directly as the overlayfs upper, bypassing the prior
  loop-device-on-VirtioFS sandwich whose closed-source virtiofsd
  returned EIO under writeback pressure on resume. Closes
  `loop-device-io-after-resume`: heavy directory churn + suspend +
  resume no longer leaves `EXT4-fs (loop0): failed to convert
  unwritten extents` / `I/O error, dev loop0` in dmesg. Universal --
  ephemeral and persistent VMs both use the new path; legacy
  loop-on-VirtioFS fallback removed from `capsem-init`. Snapshot
  (APFS clonefile) path validated byte-for-byte against the
  virtio-blk-attached file. `BootOptions::scratch_disk_path` renamed
  to `system_overlay_disk` to reflect its new role.

### Fixed (resume-stability)
- **Resume API no longer hangs 30s when capsem-process dies during
  restore.** `wait_for_vm_ready` now races the `.ready` sentinel poll
  against an instance-presence check; when the resume-side child
  exits before signalling ready, the API fails fast (~5ms-50ms)
  instead of spinning out the full readiness budget. The exit
  handler also logs the child's `exit_status` so future failures are
  diagnosable from `service.log` alone (previously the resume-side
  exit silently dropped the status).
- **Apple VZ post-restoreState handshake EOF is now retryable.**
  `is_retryable_handshake_error` accepts `UnexpectedEof` alongside
  `BrokenPipe` / `ConnectionReset` -- empirically the dominant
  fingerprint when Apple VZ tears the new vsock conn down between
  guest frames. The host re-accepts a fresh terminal+control pair
  and re-runs the handshake within the existing
  `HANDSHAKE_RETRY_MAX` budget. Prior behaviour: process exited with
  code 1, leaving the resume API to time out at 30s.
- **Control bridge holds in-flight `HostToGuest` messages across
  re-key.** When Apple VZ kills the control vsock mid-write, the
  message that was being sent (often an `Exec` or `FileWrite`
  command) used to be silently dropped, and the corresponding
  `/exec` or `/write_file` call timed out at 30s waiting for a reply
  that would never come. The bridge now stashes the failed message
  and replays it on the next successfully re-keyed connection.

### Changed (mitm-redesign)
- **Inline `policy.evaluate` deny path removed; PolicyHook is now the
  source of truth.** T1 slice 2d. PolicyHook stashes its
  PolicyDecision (allowed + matched_rule + reason) in HookCtx::state
  via the typed slot mechanism. After dispatch, handle_request reads
  the record back and uses it to populate the TelemetryEmitter (allow
  + deny paths both). On Stop(Reject(_)) the hook's response is
  wrapped with TelemetryBody so a NetEvent still fires for denies
  (no telemetry regression). Test fixtures upgraded from
  make_default_pipeline() to make_production_pipeline(policy) so
  policy actually fires in unit + integration tests. 1516 lib tests +
  8 integration tests pass; clippy clean. Slice 2d closes T1's
  rewire of the policy stage; the pipeline now owns it end-to-end.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Pre-rewrite `mitm-load` baseline captured.** T0 closes:
  `benchmarks/baselines/mitm-load/baseline.json` holds the live numbers from
  `capsem-bench mitm-load` against the un-redesigned proxy at
  concurrency 1/10/50/200 (10s per level). Highlights: rps
  1109/2862/2995/2701, p99 2.2/8.4/45.4/175.2 ms, 0 errors,
  RSS 26-230 MB. T5's CI gate compares against this file -- any
  level >2x p99 regression fails the build.

### Added (mcp + bench)
- **`local__echo` MCP tool + `capsem-bench mcp-load` mode + baseline.**
  New zero-I/O diagnostic tool: returns its `text` parameter verbatim.
  Lives in `capsem-mcp-builtin`; reachable as `local__echo` through
  the in-guest MCP server -> vsock:5003 -> aggregator -> builtin
  subprocess chain. New `capsem-bench mcp-load` mode hammers it from
  the guest with concurrent fastmcp Client calls (asyncio.gather over
  N workers per concurrency level) so we get a number for the MCP
  path's scaling shape, isolated from the MITM path. Pre-rewrite
  baseline at `benchmarks/baselines/mcp-load/baseline.json`: rps
  2162/3792/4061/3965 across concurrency 1/10/50/200, p99
  1.1/4.4/17.4/70.8 ms, 0 errors. Sub-linear scaling -- plateaus at
  ~4000 rps from concurrency 10 onwards. There IS a serialization
  point in the MCP path that needs debugging (suspect:
  stdio-framing in capsem-mcp-server, single vsock:5003 stream, or
  JSON-RPC dispatch in the aggregator). Sister to the MITM baseline,
  which plateaus around ~3000 rps with worse tails.

### Added (capsem CLI)
- **`capsem cp` -- file transfer between host and a session's
  workspace.** The service has had `GET/POST /files/{id}/content`
  upload/download endpoints for a while (used by the desktop app's
  Files tab). The CLI never exposed them. Now: `capsem cp foo.txt
  my-vm:foo.txt` (upload) / `capsem cp my-vm:bench.json
  ./bench.json` (download) / `capsem cp my-vm:log.txt -` (stdout).
  Exactly one of `<src>`/`<dst>` must be `SESSION:PATH`; PATH is
  relative to `/root` (workspace bind-mount in the guest). Errors
  loud: `guest-to-guest copy not supported`,
  `neither argument is SESSION:PATH`. New
  `UdsClient::request_bytes` returns raw response bytes + content-type
  for endpoints that don't speak JSON (the existing `request` method
  always tries to deserialize JSON, so couldn't be used for binary
  downloads).

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Pre-rewrite `mitm-load` baseline captured.** T0 closes:
  `benchmarks/baselines/mitm-load/baseline.json` holds the live numbers from
  `capsem-bench mitm-load` against the un-redesigned proxy at
  concurrency 1/10/50/200 (10s per level). Extracted via the new
  `capsem cp` command (write bench output to `/root/baseline.json`
  in the guest, `capsem cp` it to host). Highlights: rps
  1037/3043/3029/2699, p99 2.3/8.4/53.4/191.3 ms, 0 errors,
  RSS 27-260 MB. T5's CI gate compares against this file -- any
  level >2x p99 regression fails the build.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Hook pipeline now dispatches from `handle_request`
  (parallel-deploy).** T1 slice 2c: every HTTPS request through the
  MITM now runs `pipeline.dispatch(Event::RawRequestHead, ...)` with
  the per-connection `ConnMeta` (domain + process_name + port=443)
  and the ambient `trace_id`. Production builds use
  `make_production_pipeline` so `PolicyHook` fires for every request,
  emitting the `mitm.policy_decisions_total` counter and the
  structured `mitm.policy` tracing event with rule + reason fields.
  The hook's `Stop(Reject(_))` outcome is intentionally dropped this
  slice -- the inline `policy.evaluate()` call below remains the
  source of truth for the actual stop/continue decision so behavior
  is provably unchanged. Subsequent slices land TelemetryHook +
  RejectHook plumbing that lets us safely remove the inline path.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`PolicyHook` + `ConnMeta` + `make_production_pipeline`.** T1
  slice 2b: first concrete `Hook` impl. `mitm_proxy/policy_hook.rs`
  subscribes to `Event::RawRequestHead` (priority -1000 so it runs
  before any other L1 consumer), evaluates `NetworkPolicy::evaluate`
  against `ConnMeta::domain` + the request method, returns
  `Stop(Reject(403))` on deny. Tracing target `mitm.policy` records
  `decision` (allow|deny) + `rule` + `reason`; metric
  `mitm.policy_decisions_total{decision}` increments. New
  `ConnMeta` (`domain`, `process_name`, `port`) carried read-only
  through `HookCtx::conn()` so hooks can reach per-connection
  metadata not present in `RawRequestHead`. `make_production_pipeline`
  builds the registered set; `handle_request` does not yet dispatch
  through it (slice 2c). 4 new tests cover allow / deny / default-allow
  and the `evaluate_decision` rendering helper. 1516 passing.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`MitmProxyConfig` carries a `pipeline: Arc<Pipeline>` field.**
  T1 slice 2a: the `Pipeline` from slice 1 is now plumbed through the
  proxy config so subsequent slices can dispatch from `handle_request`
  without changing the public type again. `make_default_pipeline()`
  returns an empty pipeline -- the inline call graph in
  `handle_request` still drives policy / decompression / AI parsing /
  telemetry. T1 slice 2b will register the production hooks; slice 3
  wires the metrics + tracing decision contract. Three call sites
  updated: `mitm_proxy/tests.rs`, `tests/mitm_integration.rs`,
  `capsem-process/src/main.rs`.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Single `Hook` trait + `Event<'_>` ladder + dispatcher.** T1 slice
  1: pure-additive infrastructure for the new pipeline. Three new
  modules under `mitm_proxy/`: `events.rs` (15-variant `Event<'a>`
  enum across L1 raw transport / L2 protocol / L3 semantic, plus
  `EventKind` discriminator + `EventLayer` ordering + bitset
  `EventMask`), `hooks.rs` (the single `Hook` trait, `HookOutcome` =
  `Continue | Rewrote | Stop(StopAction)`, `StopAction` =
  `Drop | Reject(http::Response) | DnsReject(rcode)`, `HookCtx` with
  per-connection typed slot map for cross-call carry-over and
  `ctx.emit()`), `pipeline.rs` (registration-time-sorted dispatcher
  with O(1) per-kind plan, recursive `emit()` re-entry, layer-cycle
  prevention enforced at runtime: an L3 hook cannot emit L1/L2;
  `EmitError::CycleAttempt` returned). 16 new unit tests including:
  hook ordering by `(priority, registration_order)`, `Stop`
  short-circuit, L1->L2 emit dispatch, L3->L1 cycle rejection, typed
  state slot persistence across multiple chunk dispatches (the
  contract the future credential-rewrite hook will use), trace-id
  visibility. No production code wires the pipeline yet -- T1 slice 2
  rewires policy / decompression / AI parsing / telemetry as Hook
  impls.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`capsem-bench mitm-load` mode.** New
  `guest/artifacts/capsem_bench/mitm_load.py` drives the MITM proxy at
  configurable concurrency levels (default 1 / 10 / 50 / 200) for
  `CAPSEM_BENCH_MITM_DURATION` seconds each (default 10s) against
  `CAPSEM_BENCH_MITM_TARGET` (default a non-routable domain so every
  request fails fast at upstream-dial, isolating proxy cost from
  upstream variance). Reports per-level rps, p50/p95/p99/p99.9 latency,
  RSS peak, and error count. T5's CI gate compares to
  `benchmarks/baselines/mitm-load/baseline.json`: any concurrency level >2x p99
  regression fails the build. Baseline JSON itself is deferred --
  requires `just run "capsem-bench mitm-load"` against the
  un-redesigned proxy and commit of the result.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **Criterion bench harness + pre-rewrite baselines.** `criterion`
  (dev-dep) plus four new benches under `crates/capsem-core/benches/`:
  `parser_sse`, `parser_jsonrpc`, `interp_anthropic`, `mitm_pipeline`.
  First-run numbers committed to `benches/baselines/T0-pre-rewrite.md`
  -- T5's regression gate compares against this file via `critcmp` and
  fails CI on >5% slower medians. Baseline highlights: SSE parser
  449-472 MiB/s on 1MB corpora (plan budget 500 MiB/s), Anthropic
  interpreter end-to-end 233 MiB/s on tool-use response, metrics-facade
  counter emission 3.89 ns with no recorder installed.
- **`metrics` facade dependency + `mitm_proxy::metrics` module.**
  All counter / histogram / gauge names from the plan declared with
  `describe_*` calls in `mitm_proxy/metrics.rs`. No recorder registered
  this sprint -- T5 wires an exporter (likely OTel via
  `opentelemetry-otlp`); until then emission is a single relaxed atomic
  add against the global no-op recorder. T0 slice 4 of
  `sprints/mitm-redesign/`.

### Fixed (observability)
- **W3 IPC handshake: respect tokio's non-blocking sockets.**
  `tokio::net::UnixStream::into_std()` returns the std handle still in
  non-blocking mode. The W3 handshake's `read_exact`/`write_all` then
  bailed with WouldBlock instantly, manifesting as 95 integration tests
  failing with "peer did not send Hello within 5000ms" the first time
  any IPC channel was used. `negotiate_initiator`/`negotiate_responder`
  now flip the socket to blocking mode for the handshake (saving the
  previous flag) and restore the original mode afterward so the bincode
  channel inherits the same tokio-non-blocking shape it expects. Builds
  + 1273 integration tests now pass.

### Added (observability follow-ups)
- **W6 writer-side population.** `trace_id` is now a column AND a
  field on every event struct. Writer INSERTs the column on every row.
  Construction sites populate via
  `capsem_core::telemetry::ambient_capsem_trace_id()`. `tool_calls` /
  `tool_responses` fall back to the parent `model_calls.trace_id`.
- **`capsem_triage --id <vm>` queries session.db** for `denied_net`,
  `mcp_errors`, `exec_failures` alongside the host-log scan.
- **`capsem_timeline` joins tool_calls -> mcp_calls** so a model
  tool_use shows its servicing MCP call inline.
- **`capsem support-bundle --max-session-bytes`** (default 50MB) drops
  oldest sessions when their session.db total exceeds the cap.
- **Hot-path `#[instrument]` coverage** on `wait_for_vm_ready`,
  `pause`, `resume`, `attach_disk`, `attach_virtiofs_share`.
- **`dump_frontend_logs` Tauri command + `recordWsEvent` wiring.**
  `__capsemDebug.dumpLogs()` now returns a real jsonl path;
  `__capsemDebug.lastWsEvents` actually fills as WS events arrive.
- **Triage panic parser + redactor adversarial fixtures.**
- **`capsem-app` emits `service.start`** so cross-version-mix detection
  covers all 9 binaries (adds capsem-proto leaf dep; capsem-core
  invariant preserved).
- **Skill updates: dev-mcp** (4 new tools in tool table), **dev-debugging**
  (MCP triage trio workflow + schema_hash hint),
  **references/mcp-wire.md** (W5 `_meta` envelope + BootConfig.traceparent).
- **C1: T3 timeline SQL allowlist** enforced before `format!()`.
- **C2: `app_error_logged!`** used in fork's clone-task error path.
- **T1 (test): `tests/capsem-service/test_protocol_handshake.py`**
  exercises the W3 handshake regression.
- **CLI parity: `support-bundle` added to `CLI_ONLY` allowlist.**

### Added (observability)
- **In-band W3C trace context on the host->guest control bridge and
  on MCP JSON-RPC.** `BootConfig` now carries an optional
  `traceparent: String` so the guest agent learns the host's trace_id
  on message #1 of boot; capsem-agent stamps every subsequent
  `blog_line` log line with `trace_id=<lower 16 hex>` so guest-side
  panics, kernel errors, and init script output correlate with
  host-side spans for the same VM boot.
  `JsonRpcRequest` and `JsonRpcResponse` gain an optional `_meta`
  envelope with `traceparent` + `tracestate` (W3C Trace Context) so a
  per-tool-call trace can ride alongside the JSON-RPC payload. Both
  fields are optional with serde defaults -- third-party MCP clients
  and pre-W5 capsem peers continue to round-trip cleanly.
  Also reorganizes the post-mitm-redesign rename: `net::ai_traffic::
  {anthropic,google,openai,sse}` are now re-exports of the new
  `net::interpreters::*_interpreter` and `net::parsers::sse_parser`
  modules so existing call sites compile while new code can use the
  fully-qualified path.

### Changed (mitm-redesign)
- **`mitm_proxy.rs` decomposed into submodules.** The 1421-line file
  is now `mitm_proxy/mod.rs` (614 lines: handle_connection +
  handle_inner + handle_request + MitmProxyConfig + helpers) plus four
  sibling submodules: `body.rs` (BodyStats, RespStatsKind, ProxyBoxBody,
  TrackedBody, BodyStream, DecompressBody), `telemetry.rs`
  (TelemetryEmitter + TelemetryBody + emit_model_call), `fd_stream.rs`
  (AsyncFdStream + ReplayReader + set_nonblocking), `util.rs`
  (is_llm_api_path + split_path_query + format_headers +
  HEADER_ALLOWLIST). Each submodule keeps `pub(super)` visibility so
  the public API of `crate::net::mitm_proxy::*` is unchanged. T0
  slice 3 of `sprints/mitm-redesign/`; zero behavior change.

### Changed (mitm-redesign)
- **All remaining inline `mod tests { }` blocks in `net/` extracted to
  sibling `tests.rs` per CLAUDE.md.** `mitm_proxy.rs` shrinks from
  2847 to 1421 lines (1426 lines of tests now in
  `mitm_proxy/tests.rs`); `ai_traffic/{events,pricing,ai_body,provider,
  mod}.rs` similarly cleaned. Production code is no longer buried under
  scroll-past test fixtures; every grep / Read of a parser shows just
  the parser.

### Changed (observability)
- **W6 trace_id wiring completed across capsem-logger / capsem-core /
  capsem-process.** The `trace_id` column on `net_events`, `mcp_calls`,
  `tool_calls`, `tool_responses`, `fs_events`, and
  `audit_events` is now populated end-to-end. Write-side: every event
  emitter (`mitm_proxy`, `mcp/{gateway,builtin_tools,file_tools}`,
  `fs_monitor`, and `capsem-process` audit paths) calls
  `capsem_core::telemetry::ambient_capsem_trace_id()`. INSERT statements
  in `writer.rs` now include the new column. `tool_calls.trace_id` and
  `tool_responses.trace_id` fall back to the parent `model_calls.trace_id`
  when the per-row value is None (same agent turn). Read-side defaults
  to `None` until the SELECT clauses are extended in a follow-up.

### Changed (mitm-redesign)
- **AI parser tests extracted to sibling `tests.rs` per CLAUDE.md.**
  `parsers/sse_parser.rs`, `interpreters/anthropic_interpreter.rs`,
  `interpreters/openai_interpreter.rs`, and
  `interpreters/google_interpreter.rs` no longer carry inline
  `mod tests { }` blocks; their ~1100 lines of tests now live next to
  each prod file (e.g., `parsers/sse_parser/tests.rs`). Same pattern
  established by the obs sprint's earlier 18-file extraction.
- **Backwards-compat re-exports removed.** The transitional aliases
  `net::ai_traffic::{anthropic,google,openai,sse}` are gone; all
  internal callers (mitm_proxy, ai_body, events, provider, interpreter
  tests) reference the canonical
  `net::parsers::sse_parser` / `net::interpreters::<provider>_interpreter`
  paths. T0 slice of `sprints/mitm-redesign/`.

### Added (mitm-redesign)
- **`sprints/mitm-redesign/` scaffolded.** Meta-sprint plan to decompose
  the 2847-line `mitm_proxy.rs` monolith into a hookable pipeline with
  first-class plain HTTP, a real DNS proxy (hickory-server replaces the
  fake dnsmasq), MCP protocol awareness, and a single `Hook` trait + L1/
  L2/L3 `Event` ladder. Six phases (T0..T5) covering reorganization,
  hook traits, plain HTTP, DNS, MCP awareness, and hardening with
  performance regression CI gates. The future security engine
  (credential rewrite via regex body replace) is explicitly out of scope
  but the hook surface is shaped to host it without trait changes.

### Added (observability)
- **`capsem doctor --bundle` -- in-VM diagnostic tar wired into the
  support bundle.** `guest/artifacts/capsem-doctor` now accepts
  `--bundle [PATH]` and packages pytest output + junit XML, /var/log,
  dmesg, /proc/{mounts,cmdline}, /tmp/capsem-init.log, and
  session.db (when present) into a single tar at
  `/shared/doctor-bundle.tar` (default) or a caller-supplied path.
  Host-side `capsem doctor --bundle` lifts that file out of virtiofs
  to `~/.capsem/run/doctor-latest.tar` before the VM is destroyed.
  `capsem support-bundle` then embeds it as `doctor/bundle.tar`.
  Closes the "guest-side bug, but the bundle has only host context"
  gap in T1's bundle.

- **CI uploads `test-artifacts/` on red runs.** Both the `test-linux:`
  and `test:` jobs now have `upload-artifact@v4` steps gated on
  `if: failure()`. Reviewers get a downloadable bundle of
  `service.log`, `process.log`, `serial.log`, and `session.db` from
  every failed job without rerunning. Existing `preserve_tmp_dir_on_failure`
  in `tests/helpers/service.py` already populates the directory.
- **`just test-artifacts`** -- one recipe that finds the latest
  preserved failure dir under `test-artifacts/` and prints the file
  list with sizes. Saves digging through `ls -lt` after a red local
  run.
- **Frontend `window.__capsemDebug` console handle.** Exposed when
  the URL contains `?debug=1`. Methods: `versions()` (build_ts +
  version), `dumpLogs()` (returns the path to the latest jsonl via a
  reserved `dump_frontend_logs` Tauri command), `lastWsEvents` (small
  ring buffer; populated by api.ts when a WS event arrives via
  `recordWsEvent`). Console-only -- the visual HUD is punted to the
  frontend-rebuild sprint.

- **`capsem_timeline` MCP tool -- one tool call renders the unified
  time-ordered event stream for a session.** UNION across exec_events,
  mcp_calls, net_events, fs_events, and model_calls, ordered by
  timestamp. Filter by `traceId` to follow a single logical operation
  across layers (W6 added trace_id to every table; W4 propagates the
  id through the host process tree). Filter by `since` to scope the
  window. Optional `layers` arg accepts a comma-separated subset
  ("exec,mcp" etc.) when only some are interesting. Pre-W4 rows have
  NULL trace_id and are returned alongside matched rows so the user
  doesn't lose context that pre-dates the trace propagation.

- **`trace_id TEXT` column on every event table.** Added to
  `mcp_calls`, `net_events`, `fs_events`,
  `tool_calls`, `tool_responses`, `audit_events` (model_calls and
  exec_events already had it). Indexes added on each. Fresh DBs get
  the column from `CREATE_SCHEMA`; existing DBs get it via
  idempotent `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` on next open. Unblocks
  `capsem_timeline --trace_id <X>` to UNION across all event classes
  for one logical user action. Population through the writer API
  follows in a subsequent commit; pre-population rows are NULL and
  the timeline tool tolerates that gracefully.

- **W3C trace context propagated to every spawned capsem-* binary +
  per-stage timing on the suspend hot path.** capsem-service injects
  `CAPSEM_VM_ID`, `CAPSEM_TRACE_ID`, `TRACEPARENT`, `TRACESTATE` into
  capsem-process at spawn (cold-boot + resume paths); capsem-process
  forwards them when spawning capsem-mcp-aggregator. New helper
  `capsem_core::telemetry::child_trace_env(vm_id)` in one place; if
  this binary is itself a child of another capsem-* binary, the
  parent's traceparent is forwarded verbatim, so the whole tree shares
  one trace_id. Top-of-tree binaries synthesize a fresh
  `00-<32hex>-<16hex>-01` traceparent from blake3(vm_id + nanos).
  Suspend now emits `target=suspend op=apple_vz_pause`,
  `op=apple_vz_save_state`, `op=with_quiescence`, and
  `target=fs op=fsync path=rootfs.img` events with `duration_ms` --
  closes parent ISSUE.md pattern (6) and the today-2026-05-02
  "fsync timing was missing" debugging session.
- **Top-5 `_ => {}` enum arms now log instead of dropping.** vsock
  port dispatcher, lifecycle port, `handle_guest_msg`, and the MCP
  aggregator main match. An unknown variant now emits
  `tracing::warn!(target = "ipc", unhandled = ?other, "unknown
  variant; this binary may be older than its peer")` -- closes parent
  ISSUE.md pattern (3).

- **`capsem_panics`, `capsem_triage`, `capsem_host_logs` MCP tools.**
  AI agents (and developers via `capsem-mcp`) can now triage Capsem
  failures in one tool call without leaving the conversation:
  - `capsem_panics` -- structured panic + backtrace extractor across
    `~/.capsem/run/{service,mcp,gateway,tray}.log` and capsem-app's
    latest jsonl. Returns `[{ ts, binary, thread, location, message,
    frames }]` with `/Users/<x>/` paths redacted to `~/`. Run this
    FIRST when investigating an unexplained failure.
  - `capsem_triage` -- ranked summary of recent panics, dropped IPC
    frames (`target=ipc` warns from W1), 4xx/5xx server errors
    (`target=service` from W3.5), and slow operations (`target=fs
    op=fsync` etc., >500ms). Default lookback "30m"; accepts "5m",
    "1h", "24h", "7d", or RFC3339.
  - `capsem_host_logs` -- read any host log by symbolic name with
    grep + tail filtering. Hard-coded allowlist (no path traversal).
  Three new service HTTP endpoints (`/triage`, `/panics`,
  `/host-logs/{name}`) reuse the W2 JSON output shape, the W3 schema
  hash, and the W3.5 status field for deterministic ranking.

- **`capsem support-bundle` -- one command, one redacted tar.gz, ready
  to attach to a bug report.** Gathers `~/.capsem/run/*.log`,
  `~/.capsem/logs/*.jsonl`, the last N session directories
  (session.db + serial.log + process.log + metadata.json), assets
  manifest, redacted user.toml/corp.toml, version + OS info, dmesg
  (Linux), and a blake3 fingerprint of the MITM CA cert (the cert
  itself is NEVER bundled). Default output:
  `~/.capsem/support/capsem-support-<UTC-ts>-<host>.tar.gz`. Five
  redaction rules strip Bearer tokens, sk-/AIza/xoxb- API key prefixes,
  TOML/JSON keys named like a secret, and `/Users/<x>/` paths;
  `--no-redact` disables. `--include-rootfs` opt-in (off by default --
  rootfs.img is huge and rarely useful). Manifest schema v1 includes a
  ranked "next steps" list pointing at where to look in the bundle and
  which `target=` filters to grep for.

- **Every `AppError` returned by the capsem-service HTTP layer now
  emits a structured `tracing` event automatically.** Done in
  `IntoResponse` so all 104 `AppError(StatusCode, msg)` call sites are
  covered with zero codemod: 5xx → `error!`, 4xx → `warn!`, other →
  `info!` with `target = "service"` and the status code as a
  structured field. Pre-W3.5: the user got a 500 in the response with
  nothing in `service.log` to trace back from. Optional
  `app_error_logged!` macro lets a call site emit a SECOND event
  earlier (with the same status field) when an in-flight span is more
  informative than the late one fired at response-build time.

- **Versioned IPC handshake: cross-version mixes fail loudly in ~1s.**
  Every typed IPC connection between capsem-service and capsem-process
  now exchanges a `Hello { version, schema_hash, peer, traceparent }`
  frame on the raw UnixStream before the bincode channel takes over.
  `version` bumped to `1`. `schema_hash` is a build-script-emitted
  FNV-1a 64 hash of the protocol source bytes -- catches enum
  reordering / variant additions that don't bump version. On mismatch:
  `tracing::error!(target = "ipc", peer_id, ours_hash, peer_hash,
  "IPC handshake failed; refusing connection")` within 1 second instead
  of the pre-sprint 30-second silent timeout. Side-channel design
  (handshake on the raw stream before bincode) preserves the existing
  `Sender<ServiceToProcess>` / `Receiver<ProcessToService>` API; W1's
  `try_send!` codemod sites are unchanged. Pre-W3 binaries fail decode
  within 5 seconds (HELLO_TIMEOUT).

- **All host-side binaries now write JSON-per-line logs to
  `~/.capsem/run/{service,mcp,gateway,tray}.log`** -- consolidated
  through a single `capsem_core::telemetry::init()` entry point. Eight
  binaries (capsem-service, -process, -mcp, -mcp-aggregator,
  -mcp-builtin, -gateway, -tray, plus the macros consumer in capsem)
  now share one tracing-subscriber bootstrap. The four that previously
  emitted compact-format text (gateway, tray, mcp-builtin,
  mcp-aggregator) now emit structured JSON, so `capsem support-bundle`
  and the upcoming `capsem_panics` MCP tool can parse every host log
  with one decoder. Each binary's `service.start` line carries
  `protocol_version` + `schema_hash` so cross-version-mix can be
  detected from a single log read once W3 lands.
- **W3C `TRACEPARENT` env var captured at startup** and exposed via
  `capsem_core::telemetry::current_parent_traceparent()` /
  `ambient_capsem_trace_id()`. No OpenTelemetry runtime dep this
  sprint -- traceparent is a structured field in JSON for now;
  tracing-opentelemetry layer is a future-sprint addition. Adding it
  later is purely an additional `Layer` on the existing subscriber.

### Changed (observability)
- **Silent IPC drops in suspend/resume/exec/file paths now log at
  `target="ipc"`.** ~50 sites across `capsem-process/src/{vsock,ipc,
  main,terminal,job_store}.rs`, `capsem-service/src/main.rs`, and
  `capsem/src/main.rs` were `let _ = X.send(...)` -- a closed receiver
  silently swallowed the message with no trace. New `try_send!` macro
  in `capsem-core::macros` wraps every IPC/vsock send and emits a
  `tracing::warn!(target = "ipc", channel, error)` line on failure.
  Filter with `RUST_LOG=ipc=warn` to see only dropped-message events.
  Cleanup paths where a closed receiver is the documented design
  (e.g. broadcast publish into `TerminalOutputQueue`) keep the bare
  `let _ = ` and carry an inline `// channel-closed-ok: <reason>`
  marker so the audit grep can exclude them.

### Changed (persistent overlay)
- **EXT4 journal re-enabled on the persistent overlay-upper.** Previously
  formatted with `mke2fs -O ^has_journal`; switched to default
  `has_journal` and mount with `data=ordered`. Costs ~5-10% IOPS;
  enables metadata replay on resume so directory listings stay
  consistent after suspend/resume cycles where in-flight metadata
  writes hadn't been flushed. Verified via `tune2fs -l /dev/loop0`:
  `Filesystem features: has_journal ... metadata_csum`. Standard
  suspend/resume + heavy-churn directory listing now both work.
  (Heavy-churn DATA reads of a subset of files still hit
  `Input/output error` -- that's the loop-device-io-after-resume
  sprint's remaining work, fixable only by moving rootfs.img off
  VirtioFS to a real VZ block device.)

### Fixed (lifecycle)
- **Guest-initiated `shutdown` left persistent VMs marked Defunct
  instead of Stopped.** The lifecycle path (`capsem-sysutil shutdown`
  -> vsock:5004 -> `ProcessToService::ShutdownRequested`) had no
  service-side listener; the process just sent `Shutdown` to itself
  and exited cleanly. The cleanup task interpreted "instance still in
  the map at exit" as `unexpected_exit=true` and flipped the registry
  to `defunct`, so `capsem list` showed Defunct and the test
  `test_guest_shutdown_preserves_persistent_and_resume` failed.
  Distinguish: a clean `ExitStatus::success()` is graceful regardless
  of who initiated it; only non-zero exit / signal kill is a crash.

### Fixed (suspend/resume durability)
- **`cd /root && ls` after `capsem resume` failed with "cannot open
  directory '.': No such file or directory".** Apple VZ writes to the
  persistent overlay's `rootfs.img` were buffered in macOS's APFS page
  cache. After `save_state`, capsem-process exited before APFS flushed,
  so the next boot read a stale `rootfs.img` and the EXT4 overlay-upper
  served stale inodes -- the cwd handle in the resumed shell pointed at
  garbage. Three-stage flush now layered on suspend:
  1. Guest agent: `sync()` + `BLKFLSBUF` + `fsync(/dev/loop0)` (existed).
  2. Guest agent: `fsync(/mnt/shared/system/rootfs.img)` -- sends
     `FUSE_FSYNC` over VirtioFS so the host VirtioFS daemon flushes its
     own buffered writes against the real macOS file (NEW).
  3. Host capsem-process: `sync_all()` on `rootfs.img` after
     `save_state` returns -- catches APFS dirty pages (NEW).
  Confirmed end-to-end against the live service: simple suspend/resume
  + `cd /root && ls` works; suspend with churn across `/tmp /var /opt
  /etc /usr/local` survives; file *contents* on the EXT4 overlay are
  durable. Heavy directory churn (~50 new entries per dir then
  immediate suspend) can still leave EXT4 directory data blocks with
  stale checksums on resume -- file reads succeed but `readdir`
  returns I/O error. Tracked in
  `sprints/loop-device-io-after-resume/ISSUE.md`; the next step is
  forcing an `fsync` on each parent directory inside the guest before
  signalling SnapshotReady.
- **Failed suspend left VM marked "Suspended" with a corrupt checkpoint.**
  When `with_quiescence` failed (timeout, channel closed) the spawn task
  ignored the error, sent `StateChanged{Suspended}` anyway, and exited
  with code 0. The service then marked the VM as suspended; the next
  resume cold-booted against the half-written rootfs.img and kernel-
  panicked with `EXT4-fs error inode #N: iget: checksum invalid` ->
  `overlayfs failed`. Fix: only send the Suspended state and `exit(0)`
  when the operation actually succeeded; on failure, log the error and
  `exit(1)` so the service treats it as a crash and does not write the
  checkpoint marker.
- **Silent IPC connection close on protocol mismatch.** Two binaries
  built across an enum-variant addition (`StopTerminalStream`) talked
  past each other; the receive side closed the connection silently with
  the decoder error swallowed. Fix: log the rx error at `warn` level so
  the next protocol-skew bug surfaces in the first run instead of
  presenting as a "guest doesn't respond" timeout.

### Fixed (capsem shell)
- **Terminal garbage on shell exit.** Pressing Ctrl-C / typing `exit` in
  `capsem shell` could leave the user's parent terminal flooded with
  binary garbage (MessagePack frames -- `bootconfig`, `epoch_secs`,
  `Pong` repeated). Two compounding bugs:
  1. `output_task` (the spawned reader of `ProcessToService` IPC frames)
     was never aborted on exit. tokio `JoinHandle::drop` does NOT cancel
     -- the task lived on, kept holding `stdout`, and any in-flight
     `TerminalOutput` frame wrote to the user's now-cooked-mode shell.
  2. The host-side `capsem-process` kept queuing `TerminalOutput` for the
     dropped IPC connection because the client never told it to stop.
- Fix: `run_shell` now sends a new `ServiceToProcess::StopTerminalStream`
  before exit, aborts the local task, drops the IPC writer, and writes a
  minimal terminal reset (`\x1b[0m\x1b[?25h\r\n` -- SGR reset, show
  cursor, CRLF; deliberately no alt-screen toggle or screen clear so
  scrollback is preserved).
- Defenses: `capsem_proto::looks_like_ipc_frame` ships a detector for the
  `to_vec_named` adjacently-tagged enum prefix that produced the garbage;
  `capsem-process` calls it on every `TerminalOutput` payload and emits a
  loud `warn!` if a leak ever resurfaces. 15 unit tests in
  `crates/capsem/src/shell_exit/tests.rs` pin: the reset sequence shape,
  every variant of both `HostToGuest` and `GuestToHost` matching the
  detector, no false positives on ANSI/UTF-8/scrollback content, and
  the load-bearing tokio behavior (`JoinHandle::drop` does not cancel,
  `JoinHandle::abort` does).

### Changed (kernel)
- The backend image spec ships `kernel_branch = "auto"` instead of a
  hardcoded `"6.6"`. `resolve_kernel_version("auto")` queries
  kernel.org/releases.json and picks the newest non-EOL longterm branch's
  latest patch (today: `6.18.26`). Pin to a specific branch by setting
  `kernel_branch = "X.Y"` (e.g. `"6.6"`) for reproducibility / security
  freeze. Killed the duplicated `"6.6"` literal in `models.py` /
  the removed scaffold rail -- single source of truth is now the profile-derived
  backend image spec.

### Changed (bootstrap)
- `bootstrap.sh` moved to the repo root (was `bootstrap.sh`).
- Phase 1 now auto-installs `rustup` (sh.rustup.rs) and `just` (just.systems
  -> `~/.local/bin`) instead of printing hints and bailing.
- Phase 2 auto-installs `uv` (astral.sh), `pnpm` (brew on macOS,
  get.pnpm.io on Linux), and on macOS `colima` + `docker` + `docker-buildx`
  with Rosetta-enabled VM start (`colima start --vm-type vz --vz-rosetta
  --memory 8 --cpu 8`). Linux docker stays manual (distro-specific, sudo,
  group, daemon -- prints clear apt/dnf hints instead).
- Each install gates on a `[Y/n]` prompt; **Enter accepts** (Y is the
  default). `--yes` and non-tty input both auto-accept for CI.
- Stopped silencing every installer (`--quiet`, `>/dev/null`). Real errors
  were getting swallowed -- `uv sync` failures showed up as a mystery
  `exit 1` with no diagnostic.
- Closing message no longer tells you to run `just build-assets` (it
  already ran as part of doctor's auto-fix in Phase 3).

### Fixed (bootstrap)
- `cargo install cargo-tauri` was wrong -- the crate is `tauri-cli` (the
  binary it produces is `cargo-tauri`). Fixed in `build_system/scripts/doctor/doctor-common.sh`.

### Fixed
- **Asset download URL.** `download_missing_assets` built the URL from the
  asset version (`v2026.0424.1`) instead of the binary version (`v1.0.{ts}`),
  so every fresh install 404'd against the GitHub Release. Releases are tagged
  by binary version; the asset version lives only inside the manifest.
- **Manifest schema mismatch.** The CI release pipeline writes
  `binaries.releases.<v> = {version, files}`, but the Rust `BinaryRelease`
  struct required `{date, min_assets}`. Every published manifest was
  unparseable -- the binary couldn't even *get* to the URL builder before
  failing. Made `date` / `min_assets` / `min_binary` optional, added
  `version` / `files` to round-trip pkg/deb metadata. `pick_asset_version`
  treats empty `min_assets` as "no constraint" and falls back to
  `assets.current`.
- **Removed broken Makefile.** The legacy Makefile bypassed `_pack-initrd`,
  `gen_manifest`, and `create_hash_assets`, so `make` produced a binary that
  couldn't resolve any VM asset at boot. Use `just` for everything.

### Added (defenses)
- Pinned the asset URL contract in `asset_download_url()` with unit tests so
  future drift between the downloader and `release.yaml`'s upload step
  (`gh release upload "$f#${arch}-${base}"`) is caught at compile time.
- `verify-release-downloads` post-flight job: after every release, downloads
  the published manifest, curl-checks every `<base>/v<tag>/<arch>-<name>` URL
  is reachable, AND runs the just-released binary's `capsem update --assets`
  against real GitHub. Closes the gap that hid the URL bug for one release.
- Fixed `tests/capsem_install/test_asset_download.py`: fake release dir was
  at `v<asset_version>` (mirroring the same buggy mental model as the code).
  Now at `v<binary_version>` so it actually models GitHub.
- Dropped the `_build-host` dependency from `just test-install`. The recipe
  builds host crates inside the container that has the GTK/glib -dev libs;
  the duplicate runner-side build was failing on Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 (no
  libglib2.0-dev), which masked the asset-URL bug because the e2e never ran.

### Security (frontend deps)
- **`marked` 18.0.0 -> 18.0.3** (GHSA-6v9c-7cg6-27q7, HIGH): infinite recursion
  in tokenizer. Direct dev dep; bumped to `^18.0.2`, lockfile resolved 18.0.3.
- **`postcss` >=8.5.10 enforced via pnpm override** (GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93,
  MODERATE): XSS via unescaped `</style>` in CSS stringify output. Pulled
  transitively through `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte > vite > postcss`.
  Override forces every node in the lockfile to >=8.5.10.

### Added (CI)
- **`just audit` recipe.** Fast standalone gate (cargo audit + pnpm audit only,
  no test/build). `just test` Stage 1 already runs both audits; this is the
  pre-push check that doesn't require ~15 min of full-suite work first.
- **`test-linux` job no longer hard-fails when `/dev/kvm` is missing.** The
  "Enable KVM" step is now `continue-on-error: true`, and the verification
  step emits a workflow warning instead of `::error::` + `exit 1`. Hosted
  ARM runners do not always expose nested virt; the compile + non-KVM unit
  tests still run, and real-KVM coverage runs in the release pipeline.
  Workflow comments link future readers to `sprints/done/ci-green` so the
  hard-fail doesn't get reintroduced.

### Changed (Colima default)
- **Bumped Colima default RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB** across `bootstrap.sh`,
  `build_system/scripts/doctor/doctor-macos.sh`, three skills (`dev-setup`, `dev-start`,
  `build-images`), and four docs pages (architecture/build-system,
  architecture/custom-images, development/getting-started, development/stack).
  The Tauri install-test cold build (`just test-install`) blew past 8 GB
  during cargo compile of the capsem-mcp crates and SIGTERM'd at exit 143.
  16 GB is the recommended floor; 12 GB is the absolute minimum.
- Bumped `@tauri-apps/api` from `^2.10.1` to `^2.11.0` to match the Rust
  `tauri` v2.11.0 crate (`cargo tauri build` refuses mismatched majors/minors).

### Fixed (install-test fixture)
- `tests/capsem_install/test_asset_download.py` hardcoded `serve_dir/v1.0.1/`
  for the fake release dir, but the installed binary builds asset URLs from
  its own `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` (e.g. `v1.0.1777065213`). Every run inside the
  install-test container 404'd. Replaced with `f"v{_binary_version()}"` -- a
  helper that runs `capsem --version` once and uses the result -- so the
  fixture always matches the binary under test, regardless of release tag.

### Deferred
- **Orthogonal asset/binary release cadence** (separate tag scheme + workflow
  for asset-only bumps) is still postponed -- revisit after this URL fix
  ships. The defenses above are designed to also guard the future split.

## [1.0.1777065213] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed (CI)
- Codesign companion binaries with --options runtime + --timestamp;
  notary rejected the .pkg because the 8 companion binaries lacked
  hardened runtime.

## [1.0.1777061711] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed (CI)
- Notarize + stapler + artifact collection now reference the pkg at
  packages/ (build-pkg.sh writes there, not CWD).

## [1.0.1777059098] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed (CI)
- Raise pnpm audit threshold to high/critical (was default=low); a new
  moderate postcss CVE in dev-only deps kept failing the release.

## [1.0.1777058736] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed (CI)
- Trust productsign + productbuild on p12 import so .pkg signing
  doesn't hang on a GUI keychain prompt.

## [1.0.1777014595] - 2026-04-24

### Added (release)
- Sign the .pkg installer with a Developer ID Installer certificate
  (requires APPLE_INSTALLER_SIGNING_IDENTITY secret + combined p12).

## [1.0.1777013185] - 2026-04-24

### Diagnostic (CI)
- Preflight now enumerates all keychain identities to surface whether
  a Developer ID Installer cert is present (productsign needs it, codesign
  does not).

## [1.0.1776987645] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed (CI)
- build-app-macos: include capsem-mcp-aggregator / capsem-mcp-builtin in
  companion-binary build + codesign (build-pkg.sh needs all 8).
- build-app-linux: install libxdo-dev, libayatana-appindicator3-dev,
  librsvg2-dev so capsem-tray links.

## [1.0.1776984283] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed (CI)
- install-test: chown entire /src to capsem uid (was only /src/frontend);
  Tauri build.rs hit EACCES under the narrower chown.

## [1.0.1776982455] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed (CI)
- install-test container: chown full /src/frontend (not just node_modules)
  so vite/astro temp writes work when runner uid (1001) != container uid (1000).

## [1.0.1776981476] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed (CI)
- test-install runner now installs libgtk-3-dev + libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
  + libayatana-appindicator3-dev + librsvg2-dev + libxdo-dev + libssl-dev
  so `_build-host` can `cargo build` the tray / tauri-adjacent crates.


## [1.0.1776980282] - 2026-04-23

## [1.0.1776980020] - 2026-04-23

### Security
- **Simplified asset authorization to the profile/corp contract.** URLs are
  profile/corp-selected, downloaded bytes are verified by BLAKE3 hash/size, and
  release evidence is SBOM plus provenance attestations.

- **Asset hash verification at boot was silently disabled on every release.**
  `crates/capsem-core/src/vm/boot.rs` read three expected hashes via
  `option_env!("VMLINUZ_HASH")` / `"INITRD_HASH"` / `"ROOTFS_HASH"`, but
  nothing in the build chain ever set those env vars -- no `rustc-env=`
  emit from any `build.rs`, no shell-level pre-seed in CI, no `capsem-core
  /build.rs` at all. Every shipped binary therefore reached
  `VmConfig::build()` with `expected_*_hash: None`, skipping the hash
  check on kernel, initrd, and rootfs. Casual corruption, asset/manifest
  drift, or an attacker with write access to `assets/` all went
  undetected at boot. The compile-time embedding approach is also
  incompatible with the project's independent binary/asset release
  model (`min_binary`/`min_assets` compatibility ranges) -- baking
  specific hashes into a binary would tie every binary release to one
  asset release.
  Replaced the `option_env!` path with runtime manifest lookup. New
  `asset_manager::load_manifest_for_assets(assets)` reads `manifest.json`
  from the assets dir or its parent; new `ManifestV2::
  expected_hashes_current(arch)` returns the kernel/initrd/rootfs hashes
  for the current release on the host arch. `boot_vm` now feeds those
  to `VmConfig::builder`, so the hash check fires on every boot that has
  a manifest. Missing or malformed manifest falls back to disabled
  verification with an explicit `[boot-audit] asset hash verification
  disabled` log line, keeping dev loops without a manifest working.
  Updated `web/docs/src/content/docs/architecture/asset-pipeline.md` to
  describe the runtime-lookup flow (replacing the old "Compile-Time
  Hash Embedding" section) and fixed the mermaid diagram to match.
  Covered by 8 new unit tests in `crates/capsem-core/src/asset_manager.rs`
  covering `expected_hashes_current`, `load_manifest_for_assets`, and
  the `aarch64 -> arm64` arch mapping.

### Fixed
- **Signal-driven explicit cleanup for capsem-process background-thread
  owners.** Companion fix to the `shutdown_lock` host-serialization
  landed earlier on this branch: even with one teardown at a time, the
  previous code relied on tokio-runtime-drop ordering to run
  `DbWriter::Drop` (join writer thread + `PRAGMA
  wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) and `FsMonitor` quiescence inside the
  service's 1s SIGTERM-to-SIGKILL budget. Non-deterministic under any
  unrelated slowdown (APFS fsync spike, busy writer queue, slow VZ
  teardown) and still flaky on the observed
  `test_wal_absent_after_clean_shutdown` failure (428512-byte WAL).
  Fixed by hoisting the background-thread owners into a `Shutdown`
  struct owned by `main()` so the SIGTERM handler can drain them
  synchronously before calling `CFRunLoopStop`. New primitives:
  `capsem_logger::DbWriter::shutdown_blocking(&self)` (Arc-safe,
  idempotent -- switches `tx`/`join_handle` to
  `std::sync::Mutex<Option<...>>` so callers holding any `Arc<DbWriter>`
  can deterministically drain the writer thread; existing `Drop`
  delegates to it), and
  `capsem_core::fs_monitor::FsMonitor::shutdown_and_join(&self)` (signals
  the event loop to flush and joins its worker thread). The handler
  drains `FsMonitor` first (fs_events fan into DbWriter), then DbWriter,
  both inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so we don't stall a tokio
  worker on the thread joins; `CFRunLoopStop` runs only after the drain
  completes. Added `CAPSEM_TEST_SLOW_CHECKPOINT_MS` test-only env var in
  `writer_loop` that inserts a sleep before the final checkpoint --
  proves that explicit cleanup waits for the checkpoint where an
  implicit Drop path would race the SIGKILL budget. Documented the
  pattern in `/dev-rust-patterns` next to the host-serialization pattern.
  Covered by four new `capsem-logger::writer` tests
  (`shutdown_blocking_through_arc_flushes_wal`,
  `shutdown_blocking_is_idempotent`, `write_after_shutdown_is_noop`,
  `slow_checkpoint_hook_delays_shutdown`); the
  `test_wal_absent_after_clean_shutdown` integration test now passes
  clean under `-n 4` alongside the rest of `capsem-session-lifecycle`,
  `capsem-cleanup`, `capsem-recovery`, `capsem-stress`, and the full
  `capsem-service` suite.

- **VM teardown races under load left `session.db-wal` non-empty after
  `capsem delete`.** `handle_delete`'s fast path SIGTERMs
  capsem-process and waits 1s for exit before escalating to SIGKILL.
  Under N concurrent deletes on one host, each capsem-process's exit
  path -- Apple VZ guest teardown on the main thread, virtiofs drain,
  `DbWriter::Drop`'s writer-thread join + `PRAGMA
  wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` -- compete for the same main-thread + I/O
  bandwidth, and one teardown can blow the 1s budget. SIGKILL then
  fires mid-checkpoint, leaving a large WAL file on disk (395 kB in
  the failing `test_wal_absent_after_clean_shutdown` artifact).
  Fixed by serializing VM teardown at the service layer: added
  `ServiceState::shutdown_lock: tokio::sync::Mutex<()>`, acquired at
  the top of `shutdown_vm_process` and held through the entire
  `SIGTERM` + `wait_for_process_exit` window. Same pattern as the
  existing `save_restore_lock`: one critical-section operation in
  flight per host at a time, in-process tokio mutex since production
  runs exactly one service per user-host. `handle_purge`'s
  `join_all` of concurrent teardowns now effectively serializes
  through the lock -- intentional trade of concurrency for
  correctness; purge is an admin operation, not latency-sensitive.
  Documented in `skills/dev-rust-patterns/SKILL.md` alongside
  `save_restore_lock` as the "host-serialization locks" pattern, and
  the follow-up refactor (signal-driven explicit cleanup in
  capsem-process so cleanup-correctness doesn't depend on the
  SIGKILL budget) is scoped in
  `sprints/explicit-shutdown-cleanup/ISSUE.md`.

- **Gateway auth rejections were invisible in the log, so
  curl-returns-`000` under load was untriaged.** The gateway's
  `auth_middleware` silently returned 401/429 with no structured log
  line, and the default env filter was `capsem_gateway=info` -- so
  tower_http's per-request spans and hyper's connection-level
  complaints (malformed header, RST during read) also never made it
  into `gateway.log`. When a concurrent `just test` run surfaced
  `test_empty_bearer_returns_401` as `000` instead of `401`, there
  was nothing in the preserved test artifacts to diagnose from.
  Fixed by (a) broadening the default filter to
  `capsem_gateway=info,tower_http=debug,hyper=info` so connection-
  level events land in the log, (b) logging auth rejections at
  `info!`/`warn!` (401 / 429 respectively) with `method`, `path`,
  and a `shape` field that classifies the Authorization header
  without leaking its value (e.g. `bearer-empty`, `bearer-no-space`,
  `basic`, `unknown-scheme`, `non-ascii`), and (c) installing a
  panic hook so any panicked request handler surfaces an
  `ERROR gateway panic` rather than vanishing into a dropped
  connection. No behaviour change on the happy path; diagnostic-only
  for the flaky load-time failure mode. Covered by
  `classify_auth_header` unit tests (absent/empty/non-ascii/bearer
  shape matrix).

- **`ExecDone` always stalled 500ms on no-output commands, taxing every
  fork and every internal `sync`.** `handle_guest_msg(ExecDone)` in
  `crates/capsem-process/src/vsock.rs` used `captured.is_empty()` as a
  heuristic for "EXEC-reader thread hasn't finished depositing yet" and
  unconditionally slept 500ms on that branch. The heuristic cannot
  distinguish "deposit still in flight" from "command legitimately
  produced no stdout", so `true`, `sleep`, `exit`, and the
  `fsfreeze -f /; sync; fsfreeze -u /` pipeline `handle_fork` uses to
  quiesce the guest filesystem each paid 500ms of dead time per call.
  Visible as `test_fork_benchmark` (fork_ms mean ~110ms -> ~621ms,
  blowing the 500ms gate) and a broader regression: any command with
  no stdout took 520-570ms instead of 20-50ms.
  Replaced the heuristic with a proper deposit signal. `JobStore::
  active_exec` now holds an `ActiveExec { id, captured, deposited:
  Arc<tokio::sync::Notify> }`; the EXEC-port reader thread calls
  `notify_one()` after writing `captured` under the active_exec lock,
  and the `ExecDone` handler awaits `.notified()` with a 100ms bound
  (short safety net for guest never opening the EXEC port). Common
  path: deposit lands first, permit stored, `notified()` resolves
  immediately -- no sleep. Racy path: deposit arrives while ExecDone
  is parked, Notify wakes it; ExecDone reads the real captured bytes.
  Covered by `crates/capsem-process/src/vsock/tests.rs::
  exec_done_with_empty_stdout_resolves_without_500ms_stall`, which
  pre-deposits an empty `ActiveExec`, notifies, and asserts ExecDone
  returns under 100ms; fails at 503ms on the old code. `fail_all`
  also wakes any parked ExecDone on the deposit notifier so control-
  channel close doesn't leave the handler stuck.

- **`wait_for_vm_ready` backoff overshot VM ready-time by ~500ms,
  regressing every `provision -> exec-ready` wait.** A recent alignment
  of `wait_for_vm_ready` onto `PollOpts::new`'s project-wide defaults
  (50ms initial / 500ms max) was correct for peer pollers that wait on
  remote processes with seconds-scale startup, but wrong for this hot
  path: the ready-sentinel is a cheap local `stat` on a sub-second
  latency gate, so with max_delay=500ms the exponential curve lands
  attempts at t=50/150/350/750/1250ms and misses a VM that becomes
  ready at t~=550ms until the next 500ms boundary. Visible as
  `test_avg_exec_latency_3_concurrent_vms` / `test_lifecycle_benchmark`
  (exec_ready mean ~570ms -> ~1287ms) and `test_fork_benchmark`
  boot_ready mean (~680ms -> ~784ms). Restored the tight backoff
  (5ms/50ms) inline on this one call site, documenting why it diverges
  from `PollOpts::new` defaults. Covered by
  `crates/capsem-service/src/tests.rs::
  wait_for_vm_ready_detects_ready_within_tight_overshoot`, which
  creates a `.ready` file after 200ms and asserts detection under
  300ms.

- **Suspend/resume: sibling-VM save_state overlap corrupted the
  persistent overlay.** Apple's Virtualization.framework does not
  tolerate overlapping `saveMachineStateToURL` /
  `restoreMachineStateFromURL` calls across sibling VMs on the same
  host: the VirtioFS ring state captured inside the vzsave ends up
  referencing FUSE descriptors the host has torn down or re-keyed on
  behalf of another VM mid-operation. On the unlucky VM, resume
  surfaces as cascading `I/O error, dev loop0` plus
  `EXT4-fs (loop0): failed to convert unwritten extents to written
  extents -- potential data loss!` in the guest, and
  `initial handshake failed: BootReady read failed: failed to fill
  whole buffer` on the host. The 8% tail from
  `sprints/loop-device-io-after-resume/` was this. Added
  `ServiceState::save_restore_lock` (a `tokio::sync::Mutex<()>`) held
  across the full body of `handle_suspend` (until the per-VM
  `capsem-process` has exited and the checkpoint is durable) and
  across `handle_resume` (until `wait_for_vm_ready` confirms the
  new process's `.ready` sentinel). Production runs exactly one
  `capsem-service` per host per user, so per-service serialization is
  sufficient there. Stress harness
  `tests/capsem-mcp/test_stress_suspend_resume.py` now documents that
  it must run at `-n 1`: multiple xdist workers spawn multiple
  services and the in-service lock cannot coordinate across them,
  re-exposing the bug in a state that never occurs in production.
  With the lock, `CAPSEM_STRESS=1 ... -n 1` runs 50/50 (was noisy
  around 46-50/50 before). Scoped the pre-existing MutexGuard in
  `with_graceful_shutdown` into its own block so the compiler's Send
  analysis survives the new tokio mutex in `ServiceState`. Full
  gotcha writeup at `web/docs/src/content/docs/gotchas/
  concurrent-suspend-resume.md`; skills updated in
  `skills/dev-testing/SKILL.md` to call out the one legitimate `-n 1`
  test.
- **Test infra: capsem-service leaked across aborted pytest runs.** The
  companion reaper in `capsem-guard` only bounds tray and gateway to
  their parent service -- the service itself had no parent-watch. When
  pytest exited abnormally (Ctrl-C, xdist worker crash, hang followed
  by SIGKILL) the session-scoped fixture teardown never fired, and
  `capsem-service` plus its tray+gateway sat around until manually
  killed. `capsem-service` now accepts an optional `--parent-pid` flag
  that wires `capsem_guard::watch_parent_or_exit` into startup,
  symmetric with the existing companion behaviour: on parent death the
  service exits within ~100 ms, which lets the companion reaper take
  the tray and gateway down with it. Real daemon launches that omit
  `--parent-pid` are unaffected. Wired into the three pytest fixtures
  that spawn their own service (`tests/helpers/service.py`,
  `tests/capsem-mcp/conftest.py`, `tests/capsem-e2e/conftest.py`) so
  each one pins service lifetime to its worker. Verified end-to-end by
  spawning the service under a bash wrapper, killing the wrapper, and
  confirming `capsem-service` exits within ~100 ms; and by running the
  `test_stress_suspend_resume.py -n 8` harness and observing
  `pgrep -lf target/debug/capsem` return empty after teardown.
- **Suspend/resume: VZErrorDomain Code=12 "permission denied" on restore
  from a `/var/folders/...` path.** Apple VZ's
  `restoreMachineStateFromURL` enforces strict path matching between
  `saveMachineStateToURL` and restore -- the VirtioFS share paths
  (and any path referenced by the preserved VM state) must resolve
  identically. Under pytest the tmp_dir lands at
  `/var/folders/lv/.../capsem-test-xxx` which is a symlink chain
  through `/var -> /private/var`. If the save path was the symlink
  form and the restore resolved to `/private/var/...` (or vice versa),
  VZ rejected the restore with a security error and the VM entered
  an unrecoverable state (guest kernel came back up on a wedged loop
  device, stress harness showed 21-100+ `permission denied` entries
  per failing `process.log`). Both `capsem-service` and
  `capsem-process` now call `std::fs::canonicalize()` on their
  respective root paths (`run_dir` / `session_dir`) immediately after
  `create_dir_all`, so every downstream derivation (checkpoint path,
  VirtioFS share host_path, machine identifier, session.db, workspace
  dir, `CAPSEM_SESSION_DIR` env for guest MCP, auto-snapshot
  scheduler, MCP aggregator) uses the canonical
  `/private/var/...` form from both the pre-suspend and post-resume
  process. A reproduction outside pytest (using `~/.capsem/...`,
  which doesn't cross the `/var` symlink) passed first try -- the bug
  was pytest-path-specific. Stress harness (50 iters × 8 workers)
  goes from 4.4% VZ-permission-denied failures to 0, with the
  remaining 8% tail being the unrelated loop-device I/O error on
  the persistent overlay (tracked separately in
  `sprints/vsock-resume-reconnect/plan.md`).
- **Suspend: resume-too-soon race where the old `capsem-process`
  still held the checkpoint file.** `capsem-service::handle_suspend`
  previously returned as soon as the child emitted
  `StateChanged { state: "Suspended" }`, but the child broadcasts that
  event *before* its `save_state` finalizer syncs and the process
  exits. A quick subsequent `capsem_resume` could therefore race the
  outgoing process's `.vzsave` fsync / exit, and VZ would see either a
  partially-written checkpoint or contention over the backing file.
  `handle_suspend` now drains the broadcast channel until it closes
  (the child has exited) or a 15s timeout fires, guaranteeing the old
  process is fully gone before returning to the caller.
- **Suspend/resume: VM survives Apple VZ post-resume vsock half-opens
  and post-handshake connection resets.** The host's vsock layer now
  runs a continuous accept loop for the VM's lifetime and hot-swaps
  the underlying fd into stable terminal/control reader-writer bridges
  via dedicated re-key channels. When a connection resets
  (`BrokenPipe` / `ConnectionReset` pre-handshake, any read/write
  error mid-session) the bridges drop the dead fd, clear all
  framing buffers (no `0x81A08329` "control frame too large" misread
  of a MessagePack map header as a length header), and block on the
  rekey channel for a fresh fd produced by the guest's own reconnect
  loop. The initial handshake retries up to 3× on narrow retryable
  errors only (`BrokenPipe` / `ConnectionReset` at any level of the
  `anyhow::Error` source chain — `UnexpectedEof` and decode errors
  fail fast because they indicate a genuinely wedged guest, not the
  half-open-vsock race). Errors in `perform_handshake` now propagate
  with `.context()` so the underlying `std::io::Error` stays in the
  source chain and classification works without string matching.
  All 11 pre-refactor invariants survive: 10s heartbeat, terminal
  resize, lifecycle port for guest shutdown/suspend, audit port,
  exec duration tracking, VZ main-thread dispatch for pause/save/stop,
  fsync-after-save, error-path Unfreeze, deferred_conns processing,
  handshake on spawn_blocking, and reader-break `JobStore::fail_all`
  poisoning when the rekey channel itself closes. Stress harness
  (`test_stress_suspend_resume.py`, 50 iterations × 8 workers) goes
  from 45-48/50 to 47/50; the remaining 3 failures are an independent
  loop-device I/O error on the persistent overlay after restore (see
  `sprints/vsock-resume-reconnect/plan.md` for the handoff). Plan
  and tracker for the sprint live at
  `sprints/vsock-resume-reconnect/{plan,tracker}.md`.
- **capsem-process kept running after `setup_vsock` returned Err,
  turning every handshake failure into a 30-second service-side poll
  timeout.** The tokio task at `capsem-process/src/main.rs:424` just
  logged the error and exited, leaving the parent process alive with
  no `.ready` sentinel and no working control channel. The service
  polled `.ready` until its 30s deadline then reported a generic
  "exec-ready timeout" with no specific diagnosis. Now `std::process
  ::exit(1)` on vsock-setup failure so the service's child-exit
  handler reclaims the instance in <1s and callers (tests, CLI, MCP)
  see the failure promptly. Residual 4% tail failure seen under
  xdist stress is tracked in `sprints/vsock-resume-reconnect/ISSUE.md`
  (the real root cause is an Apple VZ half-open vsock after resume;
  the fix here just makes it surface cleanly).
- **`wait_for_vm_ready` poll hammered the sentinel 600× per 30s window
  while every other caller used 10× fewer polls.** `main.rs::wait_for_vm_ready`
  was the only site in the codebase constructing `PollOpts { max_delay:
  50ms }` directly; every peer (`service-connect`, `service-socket`,
  `gateway-ready`, `shell-socket`, guest `vsock-connect`, `reconnect`)
  uses `PollOpts::new` with the project-standard 500ms max_delay.
  Aligned this one site to the convention. Cuts sentinel-check traffic
  per second by 10× under contention without changing the 30s overall
  timeout.
- **Control-channel reader could silently wedge a VM for 30 seconds
  per command and kept the `.ready` sentinel fresh the whole time.**
  When `capsem-process`'s `ctrl_f_read` loop hit any decode/read error
  (e.g. desync, short-read, oversize frame), it logged and `break`ed
  without cleaning up. In-flight `Exec`/`ReadFile`/`WriteFile` oneshots
  registered in `job_store.jobs` never resolved, so the `ipc.rs` tasks
  awaiting them hung indefinitely; meanwhile `.ready` stayed on disk
  and `vm_ready` stayed `true`, so every subsequent `POST /exec` passed
  `wait_for_vm_ready` and then timed out at 30s too. Added
  `JobStore::fail_all(message)` which drains pending oneshots with
  `JobResult::Error`; the reader's error path now calls it and also
  removes `.ready`, clears `vm_ready`, so in-flight callers get an
  immediate error and new callers fail fast at the readiness check.
- **Handshake reads/writes ran sync on the async runtime, and every
  failure was silently swallowed.** `setup_vsock` did blocking
  `read_control_msg`/`write_control_msg` directly inside the async fn,
  so under contention (N VMs booting at once) all tokio workers could
  block on vsock I/O simultaneously -- runtime starvation slowed every
  handshake and gave guests enough time to hit their own timeouts,
  leading to protocol desync. Worse, `let _ = read_control_msg(...)`
  at the Ready and BootReady reads plus every `let _ =
  write_control_msg(...)` in the restore branch meant a half-failed
  handshake still reached `vm_ready.store(true)` and `.ready` sentinel
  creation, so callers sent commands into a broken vsock. Moved the
  handshake into `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, propagated every read
  and write error with context, and gated `vm_ready`/`.ready` on the
  handshake actually succeeding.
- **Artifact preserver left `sessions/` and `persistent/` empty in the
  archive when tests failed under contention.** The helper used
  `shutil.copytree` with an `ignore` filter. When capsem-process was
  still alive during teardown (SIGKILL hadn't reaped it yet) and was
  writing/unlinking files concurrently, copytree's error-accumulation
  model created the destination subdirectories but silently failed to
  populate them -- exactly the `persistent/<vm>/` directories that
  hold `process.log` / `serial.log` / `session.db` needed to debug
  suspend/resume failures. Replaced the `copytree`+`ignore` pattern
  with a manual `os.walk` + per-file copy loop so a single flaky file
  no longer takes out its whole parent subdir, with a stderr summary
  (`copied=N skipped=... errors=N`) and the first 10 error reasons
  surfaced so future regressions don't debug in the dark. Added
  regression tests for the concurrent-unlink race and for a >25 MB
  sibling file coexisting with small log files.
- **`just test-install` had no durable cushion against Colima disk/cache
  exhaustion.** The recipe relied on `_docker-gc`'s `until=72h` filters
  (too conservative to recover recent images / build cache) and on the
  persistent `capsem-install-target` cargo volume never going out of
  bounds. In practice the volume grew to 18.7 GB across sprint version
  bumps and images accumulated until Colima disk pressure compounded
  any OOM already in play. Added two self-healing preflight checks to
  `test-install`: (a) if Colima's `/var/lib/docker` has <10 GB free,
  run `docker image prune -af` + `docker builder prune -af` (no until=
  filter); (b) if the `capsem-install-target` volume has passed 25 GB,
  `docker volume rm` it. Both are no-ops in the common case so they
  don't thrash the cache every run. Linux hosts skip (a) since they
  don't use Colima. Guarded `colima ssh` with `</dev/null` so callers
  that pipe stdin into `just` can't stall the check.
- **`just test-install` leaked a systemd container on every failed run,
  eventually SIGTERM-killing the next build with exit 143.**
  The `test-install` recipe gave each run a unique container name
  (`capsem-install-test-$$`) and only cleaned it up on the happy path.
  Any failed `docker exec` (cargo build, Tauri build, dpkg, pytest)
  short-circuited the script under `set -euo pipefail` before the
  `docker stop`/`docker rm` at the end, leaving the privileged systemd
  container running. Stacked containers squatted Colima's 8 GiB VM
  across runs, and the next build's parallel rustc processes OOM-killed
  mid-compile -- visible as `error: Recipe test-install failed with
  exit code 143` with no pytest output. Also removed dead `EXIT_CODE=$?
  ... exit $EXIT_CODE` bookkeeping that `set -e` had made unreachable
  on the failure path. Fixed by switching to a stable container name,
  preemptively `docker rm -f`ing it at the top of the recipe, and
  installing an `EXIT` trap so cleanup runs on any exit path.
- **Docs described a fictional manifest schema.**
  `web/docs/src/content/docs/architecture/custom-images.md` claimed every build
  produced `assets/{arch}/manifest.json` with a bill-of-materials schema
  containing `packages[]` and `vulnerabilities[]` arrays -- none of which
  ever existed. `web/docs/src/content/docs/architecture/asset-pipeline.md`
  showed a different wrong schema (`{"latest", "releases": {<ver>: {<arch>:
  {"assets": []}}}}`) and mentioned legacy flat-format compatibility that
  `asset_manager.rs` no longer accepts. Both pages now document the real
  `assets/manifest.json` format 2 schema (top-level `format`, `assets.
  {current, releases.<ver>.{date, deprecated, min_binary, arches.<arch>.
  <filename>.{hash, size}}}`, `binaries.{current, releases}`) and the
  `min_binary`/`min_assets` compatibility contract. Docs site builds
  green.

- **`tests/capsem-build-chain/test_manifest_regen.py` was testing a ghost
  layout and had been silently skipping every assertion.** The fixture read
  `assets/<arch>/manifest.json` (per-arch) and the tests iterated a flat
  `{filename: hash-hex-string}` schema, but the real manifest is top-level
  `assets/manifest.json` with a nested v2 schema (`assets.releases.<ver>
  .arches.<arch>.<filename>.{hash,size}`). Both the path and the schema
  predate a refactor that was never propagated here, so the fixture's
  `pytest.skip()` fired unconditionally and all four tests reported as
  `s` in build-chain runs -- meaning the suite never actually verified
  manifest/asset consistency. Rewrote the fixture to read the real
  manifest and scope to the current release + host arch. Rewrote every
  test against the nested schema: shape check, per-file existence, b3sum
  match, and a strict `test_no_extra_assets` that allows manifest-listed
  names plus their `<stem>-<hex16>.<ext>` hash-tagged aliases and rejects
  everything else. Verified live on the current tree (4 passed) and
  proved the stale-alias gate with a planted `initrd-deadbeef12345678.img`
  that correctly fails the check.

- **`build_system/scripts/build/create_hash_assets.py` left stale hash-tagged aliases that lied
  about their content.** The script creates `<stem>-<hex16>.<ext>` hardlinks
  mirroring manifest entries so the dev layout matches the installed layout.
  It unconditionally unlinked-and-relinked each expected destination, but
  never swept hash-tagged files left over from prior builds -- and because
  `_pack-initrd` replaces `initrd.img` with fresh content on every run, the
  re-link step kept re-pointing those stale names at the new inode. End
  state in this repo: `assets/arm64/` held five `initrd-<hex>.img` names
  all hardlinked to one inode, but only one hex prefix matched the current
  content hash; the other four names claimed hashes they no longer had.
  Nothing in production reads the stale names (`asset_manager.rs` derives
  the filename from the manifest hash), but the content-addressable naming
  contract was quietly broken and any downgrade/rollback path that
  resurrected an older manifest would have served wrong bytes behind the
  right name. Rewrote the script to enumerate every `<stem>-<hex16>(.ext)?`
  filename in each arch dir and delete those not in the expected set before
  (re)creating current hardlinks. Covered by three new unit tests in
  `tests/capsem-build-chain/test_create_hash_assets.py`.

- **CAPSEM_REQUIRE_ARTIFACTS pre-flight falsely failed `just test` Stage 5
  on a successful build.** `tests/conftest.py::_REQUIRED_ARTIFACTS` declared
  the manifest at `assets/<arch>/manifest.json`, but the canonical layout
  is flat top-level (`assets/manifest.json`). Every production reader --
  `capsem-service` boot at `crates/capsem-service/src/main.rs:2740`,
  `capsem setup` at `crates/capsem/src/setup.rs:187`, `build_system/scripts/build/gen_manifest.py`,
  `build_system/scripts/release/check-release-workflow.sh` -- and the builder's
  `generate_checksums` writer at `src/capsem/builder/docker.py:700` all agree
  on the flat path. The per-arch entry was introduced with the gate itself
  in this release cycle and never resolved on a real build, so the pre-flight
  exited with a confusing "missing: ['assets/<arch>/manifest.json']" right
  after Stage 1-4 had produced the actual manifest. Fixed by correcting the
  path in `_REQUIRED_ARTIFACTS` and adding
  `test_required_artifacts_manifest_path_is_flat` in
  `tests/test_leak_detection.py` to pin the canonical location so this can't
  drift again.

### Security
- **Bumped Astro to 6.1.8 across frontend, docs, and site packages** to clear
  advisory GHSA-j687-52p2-xcff (moderate XSS in `define:vars` via incomplete
  `</script>` tag sanitization; patched in Astro >=6.1.6). `just test` Stage 1
  runs `cd frontend && pnpm audit` and was failing because
  `web/app/pnpm-lock.yaml` had locked Astro to 6.1.4 despite the caret range.
  Grepped the tree for `define:vars` and found zero usages -- exploitability
  in this codebase was nil, but `pnpm audit` gates on version, not usage, so
  the `test` recipe couldn't pass until the lockfiles refreshed. `web/docs/` and
  `web/marketing/` were bumped in the same commit because they were also on affected
  Astro versions.

### Fixed
- **Guest binaries landed on the host with 0o755 instead of 0o555 after
  container-native agent builds.** `capsem-builder agent` on macOS cross-
  compiles inside a Linux container and `chmod 555`s the binaries before
  copying them to the bind-mounted `target/linux-agent/<arch>/` output.
  Docker-for-Mac bind-mount semantics non-deterministically dropped the
  host-side mode, so `capsem-pty-agent` and `capsem-net-proxy` could
  surface as `0o755` while `capsem-mcp-server` and `capsem-sysutil`
  stayed `0o555`. The guest-binary read-only invariant (CLAUDE.md) then
  only held when the `_pack-initrd` justfile recipe ran its compensating
  chmod downstream; any caller invoking the builder directly or running
  `tests/capsem-security/test_binary_perms.py::test_agent_binaries_555`
  before repack saw the bad modes. Added
  `enforce_guest_binary_perms(paths)` in `src/capsem/builder/docker.py`
  and called it at the end of both `container_compile_agent` and
  `cross_compile_agent`, so the invariant is applied at the source by
  the builder itself. Removed the now-redundant compensating `chmod 555`
  in the justfile's `_pack-initrd` recipe. Covered by three new unit
  tests in `tests/capsem-build-chain/test_agent_perms.py`.

- **Every `tests/capsem-mcp/` and `tests/capsem-e2e/` MCP test errored
  under `filterwarnings = ["error"]`.** Both dirs spawn `capsem-mcp`
  with `stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE` to speak JSON-RPC, then tore the proc
  down with `proc.terminate() + proc.wait()` -- Popen does not close
  PIPE fds on its own, so each test leaked two
  `_io.FileIO` / `_io.TextIOWrapper` handles. pytest's strict mode
  surfaced them as `ExceptionGroup: multiple unraisable exception
  warnings (2 sub-exceptions)` at setup-teardown boundaries, turning
  69 capsem-mcp tests into `ERROR` and 4 capsem-e2e tests into
  `FAILED`. Added `kill_mcp_proc(proc, timeout=5)` in
  `tests/helpers/mcp.py` -- terminates (or kills), waits, then closes
  `proc.stdin / stdout / stderr` if non-None and not already closed.
  Rewired `tests/capsem-mcp/conftest.py::_kill_proc` through it and
  replaced four inline `proc.terminate(); proc.wait()` pairs in
  `tests/capsem-e2e/test_e2e_mcp.py`. Post-fix: 116 passed, 0 errors
  across both dirs. Covered by a unit test in
  `tests/test_leak_detection.py` that spawns a
  `sys.executable -c "sys.stdin.read()"` child with all three pipes,
  calls `kill_mcp_proc`, and asserts `.closed` on each.

- **Missing built artifacts silently skipped tests instead of failing.**
  Tests that depend on `assets/<arch>/manifest.json`,
  `assets/<arch>/initrd.img`, `build_system/packaging/macos/entitlements.plist`, or
  `target/linux-agent/<arch>/` use `pytest.skip()` when the artifact is
  absent so a fresh local checkout doesn't fail the suite. In CI, where
  earlier `just test` stages are expected to produce those artifacts, a
  skip means an earlier stage silently dropped its output -- and the
  skipped tests dropping out of the gate disguises the breakage as a
  green run. Added `pytest_sessionstart` pre-flight in
  `tests/conftest.py`: when `CAPSEM_REQUIRE_ARTIFACTS=1` is set
  (justfile's `test` recipe now sets it for both the parallel stage-5a
  and serial stage-5b pytest invocations), the hook fails the session
  before collection if any required artifact is missing, with a
  specific message pointing at the build command needed. Local runs
  without the env var are unchanged -- skips still work. Covered by
  two new unit tests in `tests/test_leak_detection.py` pinning both
  branches of `_missing_required_artifacts`.

- **Python test warnings were never promoted to errors.** `pyproject.toml`
  `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` had no `filterwarnings`, so
  `DeprecationWarning`, `ResourceWarning`, and (critically)
  `PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning` were reported but never gated. Real
  fd / socket / thread-resource leaks in both tests and production
  scripts therefore shipped green. Set `filterwarnings = ["error"]` and
  fixed every leak surfaced:
  - `build_system/scripts/build/clean_stale.py` -- all six `os.scandir(...)` call sites
    were either unbracketed (iterator GC'd eventually, but not
    deterministically) or, in `_target_release_has_old_content` and
    `_dir_has_no_recent`, returned early mid-iteration leaving the
    iterator open. Wrapped each in `with os.scandir(...) as entries:`
    so the underlying fd is released on scope exit regardless of
    return path.
  - `build_system/tests/policy/test_exec_lock.py` -- the `_spawn_holder` helper returned
    a `subprocess.Popen` with `stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE`; tests
    `.wait()`'d but never closed the pipe fds. Hoisted the two
    callers into `with ... as holder:` blocks so Popen's own
    `__exit__` closes the pipes.
  - `tests/capsem-gateway/test_gw_terminal.py` -- `ws_env` fixture
    teardown called `svc_server.shutdown()` (stops
    `serve_forever`) but never `svc_server.server_close()` (releases
    the UDS listen socket). Added the close plus
    `svc_thread.join()`.
  - `tests/capsem-gateway/test_gw_lifecycle.py` -- the SIGTERM /
    SIGINT lifecycle tests called `gw.start()` but never
    `gw.stop()`, so the gateway log-file handle leaked even though
    the gateway process was killed by signal. Wrapped the asserts
    in `try/finally: gw.stop()`.
  - `tests/capsem-service/test_companion_lifecycle.py` -- the
    restart-with-same-run-dir test needed svc_a's log fd closed
    without destroying the shared tmp_dir (svc_b reuses it);
    added an explicit `svc_a._log_file.close()` between the two
    services. `_spawn_service_on_fixed_port` opened its own log
    file anonymously (`stdout=open(log_path, "w")`) so the
    six-rapid-restarts test could not reach it; it now stashes
    the handle on `proc._log_file` and the test closes every
    spawned service's log file in its finally block.

- **Unhandled exceptions in daemon threads were not failing the test
  suite.** Python surfaces thread exceptions as
  `PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning`, which is reported but has
  never been gating in `pyproject.toml`. Real races (e.g. today's
  `MockWsProcess` teardown hitting `loop.stop()` while
  `run_until_complete` was awaiting) shipped green until someone
  eyeballed the warning in a test run. `tests/conftest.py` now installs
  a process-wide `threading.excepthook` at import time (covers
  collection, fixture setup, and every test) that records each caught
  exception in `_CAUGHT_THREAD_EXCEPTIONS` and prints the traceback to
  stderr in real time. `pytest_sessionfinish` fails the session if that
  list is non-empty. Per-process (each xdist worker gates its own;
  thread exceptions are process-local, unlike process leaks which need
  cross-worker visibility). Covered by two new tests in
  `tests/test_leak_detection.py`: hook-is-installed, and
  captures-real-daemon-thread-exception. Also removed the stale
  `tests/capsem-build-chain/conftest.py.bak` (orphaned after the
  `capsem-cli` -> `capsem` / `capsem-ui` -> `capsem-app` rename).

- **Leak detector false-positived sibling `capsem-mcp` processes.** The
  per-test `check_leaks` fixture and the `pytest_sessionfinish` gate in
  `tests/conftest.py` defined "leak" as any `capsem-*` PID on the host
  not present in the import-time baseline. That caught sibling tools
  sharing the host with pytest -- notably Claude Code's own
  `capsem-mcp` stdio subprocess (spawned by the `claude` CLI, not
  pytest) -- and attributed them to whichever test happened to run
  first. Example report: `[master] tests/capsem-build-chain/test_
  cargo_build.py::test_all_binaries_exist 49423 capsem-mcp
  target/debug/capsem-mcp` (PID 49423's PPID chain: `claude` ->
  terminal shell; pytest never in the chain). Added `_ancestry(pid)` +
  `_is_pytest_descendant(pid)` (walk `psutil.Process.parent()` up to
  init) and gated both sites: `check_leaks` only records first-seen
  when the suspect is actually descended from this pytest process,
  and `pytest_sessionfinish` only flags suspects with either
  attribution (recorded by a worker's `check_leaks`) or a live
  ancestry link to the controller. Sibling processes pass neither
  gate and are silently ignored. Covered by three new unit tests in
  `tests/test_leak_detection.py` (ancestry of init excludes self;
  ancestry of own subprocess includes self; ancestry of nonexistent
  PID is empty).

- **`PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning` from `test_gw_terminal.py`
  module teardown.** The `MockWsProcess` daemon thread in
  `tests/capsem-gateway/test_gw_terminal.py` ran
  `loop.run_until_complete(server.serve_forever())`, and `stop()` tore
  the loop down with `loop.call_soon_threadsafe(loop.stop)`. Stopping a
  running loop while `run_until_complete` is awaiting a pending future
  is the exact case that raises `RuntimeError: Event loop stopped
  before Future completed.` on the worker thread; pytest picked it up
  at module teardown (visible on the last test, e.g.
  `test_ws_nonexistent_vm_closes`). Replaced `serve_forever()` with an
  `asyncio.Event`-based shutdown: `_serve` parks on the event and closes
  the server in its `finally`; `stop()` just sets the event via
  `call_soon_threadsafe`, letting `run_until_complete` return cleanly
  and the worker thread exit. Added a direct regression test
  (`test_mock_ws_process_stop_does_not_leak_thread_exception`) that
  installs a `threading.excepthook` and fails if any exception escapes
  the worker thread.

- **`capsem-agent` failed to compile under `clippy::manual-strip`.** The
  `extract_field` audit-log parser in `crates/capsem-agent/src/main.rs`
  hand-rolled a `starts_with('"')` + `rest[1..]` prefix strip that clippy
  1.93's `manual_strip` lint (denied via `-D warnings`) refused. Rewrote
  to `rest.strip_prefix('"')`; semantics unchanged (`stripped.find('"') + 2`
  still yields the same end offset into `rest`).

- **`capsem_read_file` returned ENOENT on real files after `capsem_resume`
  under concurrent load.** The guest agent's post-resume rebind polled
  `/mnt/shared/workspace` with `Path::exists`, which only drives a FUSE
  `GETATTR`. Under `pytest -n 4 --dist=loadfile` (4 concurrent VMs sharing
  one host's virtiofsd pool) virtiofsd could answer GETATTR on the
  workspace dir before it had populated its child-inode map, so `exists()`
  returned true, the agent `mount --bind /mnt/shared/workspace /root`'d an
  empty view, and every subsequent `/root/<file>` read returned ENOENT
  even though the host file was durably on disk (604319f already made
  write_file flush to host). Fix in `rebind_workspace_after_resume`
  (`crates/capsem-agent/src/main.rs`): warm-poll now calls
  `std::fs::read_dir(...).next()`, forcing a FUSE `READDIR` round-trip
  and proving virtiofsd has enumerated child inodes. Warming timeout
  (1 s total, 50 × 20 ms) is unchanged. If warming never completes the
  rebind now aborts instead of binding against an empty subtree, so the
  failure surfaces loudly in `read_file` rather than silently corrupting
  `/root`. Verified against the previously-flaky
  `tests/capsem-mcp/test_state_transitions.py::test_suspend_and_resume_persistent`
  under `-n 4 --dist=loadfile` (1/1 fail pre-fix, 5/5 pass post-fix).

- **`PytestUnknownMarkWarning` on `benchmark` marker.** Registered
  `benchmark` in `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest.ini_options].markers` so
  `tests/capsem-serial/test_parallel_benchmark.py`'s
  `pytest.mark.benchmark` no longer emits the warning. Warnings are
  errors per CLAUDE.md.

- **Stage-5 flake: pytest `check_leaks` fixture crashing at teardown.** Under
  concurrent load, macOS `sysctl(KERN_PROCARGS2)` can deny cmdline access for
  an unrelated host process; psutil surfaces that as an uncaught `SystemError`
  / `PermissionError` that dropped out of `process_iter(['pid','name','cmdline'])`
  before the existing per-iteration `try/except` could run, taking down the
  teardown of whichever test held the turn (observed on
  `test_cors_on_authenticated_endpoint`). Fix: `tests/conftest.py`'s
  `get_capsem_processes` now iterates without attr-prefetching cmdline and
  fetches cmdline lazily with a per-proc `try/except (psutil.Error, OSError,
  SystemError)`. Unit coverage in `tests/test_leak_detection.py`.

### Performance
- **`capsem delete` and `capsem purge` no longer pay the 2.7s graceful
  shutdown floor.** Previously `shutdown_vm_process` unconditionally sent
  `ServiceToProcess::Shutdown` via IPC, which armed capsem-process's 2.5s
  self-timer (giving the guest agent `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS` to SIGTERM bash
  gracefully before SIGKILL) before the caller could observe process
  exit. Delete/purge don't need that grace because the session dir (with
  its workspace and bash history) is about to be removed anyway. Added a
  `graceful: bool` parameter to `shutdown_vm_process`; `handle_delete` and
  `handle_purge` now pass `false`, which SIGTERMs capsem-process directly
  (its `CFRunLoopStop` handler from 9b14618 makes this a clean exit) with
  a 1s poll before escalating to SIGKILL. `handle_stop` and `handle_run`
  keep graceful=true (persistent VMs need bash history preserved;
  handle_run reads session.db after teardown). Observed delete mean
  dropped from 2782 ms to ~70 ms across 3 benchmark runs, unblocking
  `tests/capsem-serial/test_lifecycle_benchmark.py::test_lifecycle_benchmark`
  under `just test` stage 5.

### Changed
- **Convention: Rust unit tests live in a sibling `tests.rs`, not an inline
  `mod tests { ... }` block.** Documented in `CLAUDE.md` (Code Style) and
  `skills/dev-testing/SKILL.md` (with extraction recipe and rationale).
  Codifies the pattern just applied across `policy_config`, `session`,
  `capsem-proto`, and `virtio_fs`. Agents writing new Rust modules should
  default to the sibling pattern; reviewers should push back on new inline
  test blocks.

### Fixed
- **`capsem-agent` `write_nofollow`: fsync before returning so
  `capsem_write_file` is durable across an immediate `capsem_suspend`.**
  Previously the agent did open+write+close without fsync. On VirtioFS, close
  only triggers FUSE_FLUSH (which virtiofsd is free to no-op), so the write
  could still be buffered inside Apple VZ's in-process virtiofsd when a
  caller immediately suspended the VM. VZ tore down virtiofsd before the
  data reached the host backing store, and the resumed VM (with a fresh
  virtiofsd) saw ENOENT. Surfaced as a concurrency flake of
  `tests/capsem-mcp/test_state_transitions.py::test_suspend_and_resume_persistent`
  under `just test` stage 5 -- 2 ms between write_file returning and the
  suspend request is not enough time for Apple's virtiofsd to drain.
  `file.sync_all()` sends FUSE_FSYNC, a core FUSE opcode virtiofsd must
  honor, giving write_file a real durability contract.
- **`capsem-logger/src/writer.rs`: `clippy::type_complexity` in
  `exec_event_insert_populates_row` test.** The test declared an
  8-element tuple type on the destructuring binding for a
  `Connection::query_row` call; clippy flagged it under
  `--all-targets -- -D warnings`. Replaced the outer type annotation
  with per-column `let` bindings inside the closure, which also makes
  each column's expected type read at the call site rather than in a
  parallel tuple. No behavior change; `cargo test -p capsem-logger`
  still 210 pass.

### Changed
- **Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` blocks extracted to sibling
  `tests.rs` files across four hot-path modules.** Pure mechanical code
  motion -- each block moved verbatim (dedented one level) into a new
  `tests.rs` alongside its parent, and the parent now declares
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`. Test visibility is identical to inline;
  zero behavior change. Before / after line counts:
  `capsem-core/src/net/policy_config/mod.rs` 4,364 → 38
  (tests.rs 4,325); `capsem-core/src/session/mod.rs` 1,230 → 12
  (tests.rs 1,217); `capsem-proto/src/lib.rs` 1,722 → 403
  (tests.rs 1,318); `capsem-core/src/hypervisor/kvm/virtio_fs/mod.rs`
  1,218 → 313 (tests.rs 904). Net: ~7,800 lines of test code no longer
  sits between file open and production definitions, which was the
  single biggest friction when agents or humans navigate these files.
  Full suite green: `cargo test -p capsem-core` 1,464 pass;
  `cargo test -p capsem-proto` 144 pass; clippy clean on every
  touched crate.

### Changed
- **`capsem-service`: `PersistentRegistry` extracted from `main.rs` into its
  own `capsem_service::registry` module.** Pure code motion: `PersistentVmEntry`,
  `PersistentRegistryData`, and `PersistentRegistry` with its eight methods
  (`load`, `save`, `register`, `unregister`, `get`, `get_mut`, `list`,
  `contains`) now live in `crates/capsem-service/src/registry.rs` and are
  re-imported by `main.rs`. Seven registry-only tests move with the types;
  seven new tests drive the module to 100% line coverage (corrupt-JSON
  load, missing-file load, `get` / `get_mut` / `contains` miss paths,
  `list` iteration, atomic temp-rename on save). Moved tests switch from
  ad-hoc `env::temp_dir()` + manual cleanup to `tempfile::TempDir` to
  eliminate cross-run path collisions. `main.rs` drops from 4,855 to
  4,563 lines. No behavior change; first step of the
  `capsem-service-split-followup` sprint (T1).

### Added
- **Unit-coverage lifts on six files to recover the `unit` codecov flag.**
  Workspace line coverage had regressed below the 80% unit target after
  several service/CLI mains grew. Added 55 new tests across
  `capsem-core/src/vm/terminal.rs` (was 0%, now ~100%),
  `capsem-core/src/net/policy_config/types.rs` (was 45%),
  `capsem-core/src/net/policy_config/corp_provision.rs` (was 40%; tests
  exercise install/read/refresh paths against a tempdir plus the
  stale-TTL guard), `capsem-core/src/net/policy_config/loader.rs` (was
  79%, new coverage on `parse_mcp_section` / `parse_mcp_section_json` /
  `validate_setting_value`), `capsem-logger/src/writer.rs` (ExecEvent,
  McpCall, AuditEvent roundtrips plus `try_write` and `:memory:` reader
  rejection), and `capsem-process/src/helpers.rs`
  (`query_max_fs_event_id`). Workspace unit coverage moved from 76.79%
  to 77.49% lines / 80.78% regions / 78.85% functions; the remaining
  gap to 80% lines is concentrated in `capsem-service/src/main.rs`,
  `capsem/src/main.rs`, and `capsem-process/src/vsock.rs` and is tracked
  by `sprints/capsem-service-split-followup/`.

### Fixed
- **Flaky env-var race in `policy_config/loader.rs` tests.**
  `user_config_path_override_via_env`, `corp_config_path_override_via_env`,
  and `corp_config_path_default` each mutated `CAPSEM_USER_CONFIG` /
  `CAPSEM_CORP_CONFIG` at process scope, so parallel cargo-test execution
  could observe one test's `set_var` while another asserted the env was
  unset. Merged the three into one `env_var_path_resolution` test that
  snapshots and restores prior values. No production behavior change --
  these env vars are set once at startup in prod.

### Changed
- **Marketing tagline updated to "The fastest way to ship with AI securely."**
  Replaces the previous "Native AI Agent Security" / "Sandbox AI coding agents..."
  phrasing across the marketing site hero, footer, and meta tags; the docs site
  splash and description; the workspace `Cargo.toml` package description; the
  `capsem --help` about line; the `capsem setup` welcome; the macOS `.pkg`
  installer welcome page; and the README header.

### Added
- **Integration-test fixtures archive their tmp_dir on failure.** When any
  test that spins up a capsem-service via `tests/helpers/service.py::ServiceInstance`,
  the e2e `RealService`, or the MCP conftest's `_start_capsem_service`
  fails, the fixture teardown now copies its
  `/var/folders/.../capsem-test-*` directory into
  `test-artifacts/<timestamp>-<worker>-<nodeid>/<tmp-basename>/` before
  the usual `shutil.rmtree`, so `service.log`, `logs/gateway.log`,
  `sessions/<vm>/process.log`, `sessions/<vm>/serial.log`, and
  `sessions/<vm>/session.db` all survive for post-mortem. The failing
  test's stderr prints `ARTIFACT: preserved <src> -> <dest>`; Unix
  sockets/FIFOs are skipped because `shutil.copy2` can't read them.
  `test-artifacts/` is gitignored. `skills/dev-debugging/SKILL.md` and
  `skills/dev-bug-review/SKILL.md` document the layout and when to read
  it -- first stop for "VM didn't boot" and "exec timed out" failures
  in the integration suite, where log availability used to depend on
  whether macOS had culled `/var/folders` yet.

### Changed
- **Temp VM names now suffix `-tmp` and never collide on the first word.**
  Auto-generated names went from `tmp-<adj>-<noun>` to `<adj>-<noun>-tmp`
  (e.g. `brave-falcon-tmp`) so every tab/list entry leads with a
  distinctive adjective instead of the same `tmp-` prefix. The generator
  also consults the live instance table and skips any adjective that
  matches the leading segment of an existing VM name, so two concurrent
  temp VMs never share a first word. The adjective and noun rosters were
  expanded (68 adjectives, 85 nouns) to keep the avoid-set useful even
  under heavy concurrency, and the generator falls back to a random
  adjective if every one is already claimed. `build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py`
  was updated to match on the `-tmp` suffix instead of the prefix.

### Changed
- **Throughput benchmark target moved off `ash-speed.hetzner.com`.** The
  `capsem-bench throughput` command, the in-VM `test_proxy_download_throughput`
  diagnostic, and the host-side `mitm_proxy_download_throughput` integration
  test all pointed at `ash-speed.hetzner.com/{1,10,100}MB.bin`, which has
  been 404ing silently (the integration-test swap in `bdc8c12` already
  noticed -- curl reported 146 bytes of nginx error page while every
  test asserted only "request logged + decision=allowed"). Swapped all
  three to `https://cdn.elie.net/static/files/i-am-a-legend/i-am-a-legend-slides.pdf`
  (~9.5 MB via Cloudflare, 301-redirects to `elie.net`). Size constants
  dropped to a conservative 9 MiB floor and the curl invocations gained
  `-L` so the proxy's 301-follow is exercised; the Rust test hits
  `elie.net` directly because raw hyper does not follow redirects.
  Dropped `ash-speed.hetzner.com` from the default web allow list
  (`config/defaults.toml`, `guest/config/security/web.toml`, and the
  hand-written `web/app/src/lib/mock-settings.ts`) since no live test
  or config still needs it; regenerated `config/defaults.json` and
  `web/app/src/lib/mock-settings.generated.ts` from the TOML. Docs
  page `web/docs/src/content/docs/development/benchmarking.md` updated to
  match.

### Added
- **`build_system/tests/packaging/test_repack_deb.py` -- 6 pytests that exercise
  `build_system/packaging/linux/repack-deb.sh` directly in under a second.** Previously the
  repack step was only validated through `just test-install`, which
  takes minutes (Tauri build + systemd container + pnpm install)
  before any repack-related bug surfaces. The new harness builds a
  minimal fixture `.deb` with `dpkg-deb -b`, seeds fake companion
  binaries, and invokes the script end-to-end; coverage includes the
  happy path (all six companion binaries land at `/usr/bin/<name>`
  with mode 0755), `DEBIAN/postinst` copy fidelity, loud failure when
  a companion binary is missing, loud failure when the input path
  contains an embedded newline (regression for the `ls *.deb`
  multi-match bug), the build-timestamp stamp on `Version:`, and
  output-defaults-to-overwriting-input semantics. Skipped with a
  clear message when `dpkg-deb` is not on PATH (macOS default); runs
  in Linux CI and inside the `capsem-install-test` container.
  Verified in-container: 6 passed in 0.17s.
- **`just test` now records an in-VM capsem-bench baseline on every
  run.** The stage-6 "Benchmarks" step used to call
  `{{binary}} "capsem-bench"`, which clap parsed as a host-side
  subcommand and aborted with `unrecognized subcommand 'capsem-bench'`.
  Replaced with a new pytest
  (`tests/capsem-serial/test_capsem_bench_baseline.py`) that provisions
  a fresh VM, runs `capsem-bench all` inside it, pulls
  `/tmp/capsem-benchmark.json` out via `/exec cat`, and archives it to
  `benchmarks/baselines/capsem-bench/data_<version>_<arch>.json` with host-side
  timestamp + arch stamp. Mirrors the `_save_benchmark` pattern used by
  the existing `test_lifecycle_benchmark.py` host-side archives
  (`benchmarks/baselines/lifecycle/`, `benchmarks/baselines/fork/`). No regression gate
  yet -- once ~5-10 clean archives land per arch, per-category
  tolerances can be picked and promoted to pytest asserts, mirroring
  `OP_GATE_MS` / `FORK_GATE_MS` / `IMAGE_SIZE_GATE_MB` in the
  lifecycle benchmark. Host-side lifecycle/fork regressions remain
  gated today.
### Fixed
- **Service reaps `capsem-process` orphans on startup when reusing a run_dir.**
  A SIGKILL to capsem-service (crash, OOM, or `svc.proc.kill()` in the
  recovery test suite) does not propagate to its per-VM children. The
  children kept running with their `--session-dir` still pointing at the
  dead service's run_dir, holding Apple VZ VMs, vsock ports, and sockets
  indefinitely. When a replacement service started on the same run_dir it
  only removed stale socket files -- the orphan processes themselves
  persisted across the entire test session.
  Added `find_orphan_capsem_pids` + `reap_orphan_capsem_processes` in
  `crates/capsem-service/src/main.rs`: on startup (after creating
  `instances/`, before socket cleanup), shell out to `ps`, filter
  `capsem-process` lines whose cmdline contains `--session-dir <run_dir>`,
  SIGTERM them, poll up to 2s, SIGKILL survivors. The matcher is a pure
  function with four unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` covering happy path,
  unrelated run_dir, non-capsem-process binaries that happen to mention
  the run_dir, and empty input. After the fix, the recovery tests
  (`tests/capsem-recovery/test_orphaned_process.py`,
  `test_service_health_after_recovery.py`) leave zero surviving
  `capsem-process` children.
- **Leak detector: controller-only gate + cross-process attribution.**
  Under `-n 4`, each xdist worker ran its own `pytest_sessionfinish` and
  flagged every other worker's session-scoped fixture processes as a
  "leak", because workers cannot distinguish their own children from
  peers' on the shared host. The in-worker gate also fired mid-teardown
  against processes that would have exited a second later via
  capsem-guard. Restructured: workers now only record first-seen
  attribution to `tests/leak-attribution.jsonl` (shared append log) and
  do NOT fail their session; the controller / single-process runner does
  the real gate at `pytest_sessionfinish`, after every worker has
  finished, when the host is the source of truth. The controller settles
  suspects with an exponential-backoff poll (50 ms -> 500 ms, 15 s
  budget) mirroring `capsem_core::poll::poll_until`, filters by the
  conftest-import-time baseline, merges worker attribution from the
  jsonl, and writes a deduped report to `tests/leak-report.log`. Verified
  `tests/capsem-mcp/ + tests/capsem-recovery/ -n 4` now finishes with
  zero reported leaks and zero surviving `capsem-*` processes on the host.
- **Leak detector: eliminate false positives and xdist-controller double-reporting.**
  `tests/conftest.py`'s `get_capsem_processes` was matching `'capsem-' in arg`
  across every process's full cmdline, so `cargo build -p capsem-*`, `rustc`
  driving a capsem crate, and every unrelated tool invoked from a path
  containing `capsem-next/` showed up as a "leak". The per-test check_leaks
  fixture also logged a line for every session-scoped fixture process on every
  test it outlived, so a single shared_vm in a 20-test file produced 20 false
  leak entries. On top of that, under `-n 4` the xdist controller process --
  which never runs session-scoped fixtures or tests -- also ran
  `pytest_sessionfinish` with an empty baseline and re-reported every capsem
  process as `<unknown>`. Rewrote the detector: match on `psutil` process
  name starting with `capsem-` (no cmdline scanning); snapshot the baseline
  at conftest import time so the xdist controller sees one too; per-test
  fixture now only records first-seen attribution; real leak check fires
  once at `pytest_sessionfinish` against processes still alive not in the
  baseline; skip the check entirely in the xdist controller and let each
  worker report its own leaks with real attribution. Verified
  `tests/capsem-build-chain/` and `tests/capsem-mcp/ -n 4` now produce no
  false-positive leak entries.
- **Stop logging routine VM lifecycle transitions at WARN.** Two `tracing::warn!` lines in capsem-service were firing on every normal shutdown -- "shutdown_vm_process removing instance" and "provision_sandbox child exit handler removing instance" -- which made the warn channel useless for actual problems. The first is now `debug!`. The second was further wrong: it fired *before* checking whether the child died unexpectedly vs after an explicit shutdown. Moved the warn inside the `if let Some(info) = removed` branch so it only fires for the genuinely surprising case (and reworded to say so), with a `debug!` for the expected post-shutdown path.
- **`shutdown_vm_process` is now synchronous: awaits actual exit + cleans the UDS socket inline, no background reaper.** Previously it spawned a fire-and-forget `tokio::spawn` to wait for the process and remove the socket, which left every caller racing the reaper. `handle_delete`, `handle_run`, and `handle_stop` were each working around this by calling `wait_for_process_exit` themselves (or hand-rolling the same loop), and `handle_purge` -- which fan-outs via `join_all` -- was the only one *not* working around it, so its parallel shutdowns relied on the reaper to clean up. Collapsed all of this: `shutdown_vm_process` now blocks on `wait_for_process_exit(pid, 5s)` and removes `*.sock` / `*.ready` itself, dropping ~50 lines of duplicate poll/SIGKILL/cleanup code from the four call sites and giving every caller a single clean contract -- when this returns, the process is gone, the socket is removed, and the session DB has flushed.
- **VM process cleanup now uses `poll_until` instead of hand-rolled fixed-interval loops, and `handle_run`/`handle_delete` synchronously await process exit before responding.** `wait_for_process_exit` was polling at fixed 100ms intervals and `handle_delete` was reinventing the same loop inline (with a different timeout, racing the background reaper from `shutdown_vm_process`). Switched the helper to `capsem_core::poll::poll_until` (50ms initial, exponential backoff to 500ms cap) and routed `handle_delete` + `handle_run` through it, which (a) removes the duplication, (b) cuts common-case latency since most processes exit in <50ms, (c) gives both endpoints the SIGKILL fallback for free, and (d) eliminates the `handle_run` race where the response could be returned before the VM process was actually gone (root cause of leak-detector false positives in `tests/capsem-mcp/`).
- **Fixed clippy break in `kill_all_vm_processes`** introduced by the prior service-shutdown cleanup change. The for-loop was switched to borrow `pids_and_sockets` (so `uds_path`/`session_dir` became references), but the existing `&uds_path`/`&session_dir` calls weren't updated, producing two `clippy::needless_borrows_for_generic_args` errors that broke `just test` Stage 1.
- **Improved VM process cleanup in delete handler.** Replaced fixed wait loops with bounded polling and SIGKILL fallback in `handle_delete` to ensure robust cleanup of `capsem-process` instances during deletion.
- **Fixed zombie process leak in service test helper.** Added `wait()` after `kill()` in `ServiceInstance.stop` to ensure child processes are fully reaped.
- **Wired capsem-guard into MCP subprocesses.** Added `capsem-guard` to `capsem-mcp-aggregator` and `capsem-mcp-builtin` to ensure they exit when their parent process dies, eliminating leaks.
- **Improved service-side VM process cleanup.** Replaced fixed 500ms sleep with a bounded polling loop (up to 2s) and SIGKILL fallback in `kill_all_vm_processes` to ensure robust cleanup of `capsem-process` instances.
- **`_clean-stale` now caps each cargo kind directory by size, so
  target/ stops growing unbounded during active dev.** The age-only
  prune (remove entries older than 2-3 days) never fired in practice
  because every build touches every `deps/`, `incremental/`, `build/`,
  and `.fingerprint/` entry -- nothing ever crossed the age threshold
  and the recipe's report said `cargo removed=0` while `target/` sat
  at 72 GB on `/System/Volumes/Data` (23 GB of that in
  `target/debug/incremental/` alone; push to 100% full triggered
  ENOSPC in several integration tests). Added a second pass to
  `build_system/scripts/build/clean_stale.py::clean_cargo_artifacts` that, for each
  profile (debug/release/llvm-cov-target), enforces a per-kind size
  budget (`deps` 12 GB, `incremental` 3 GB, `build` 1 GB,
  `.fingerprint` 500 MB) by deleting oldest-mtime entries until the
  total drops under cap. Newest entries survive so a warm build cache
  is preserved. `deps/` pruning scopes to cargo-generated extensions
  (`.rlib`, `.o`, `.rmeta`, `.d`) -- test binaries are left alone.
  Added 3 tests (budget evicts oldest, no-op under cap, deps filter
  scopes by extension); existing 16 clean_stale tests still pass.
  Measured on this machine: 72 GB -> 30 GB, 110,400 entries evicted
  in 21 s.
- **Artifact capture no longer fills the disk with rootfs.img copies.**
  `tests/helpers/service.py::preserve_tmp_dir_on_failure` recursively
  copied every file from a failing test's `/var/folders/.../capsem-test-*`
  tmpdir into `test-artifacts/`, including per-VM `sessions/<id>/system/rootfs.img`
  (~2 GB each, plus the `auto_snapshots/0/system/rootfs.img` clones).
  29 failure dirs consumed 18 GB apparent / ~9 GB real (APFS clone
  sharing) on /System/Volumes/Data -- enough to push the host to 100%
  and cause downstream ENOSPC failures in other tests. Taught the
  `shutil.copytree` ignore callback to skip (a) files named `rootfs.img`
  / `rootfs.img.backing`, (b) any regular file larger than
  `ARTIFACT_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (25 MB), and (c) sockets/FIFOs (pre-existing).
  Added a rotation pass: after every preserve, only the
  `ARTIFACT_MAX_KEPT_DIRS` most-recent subdirs under `test-artifacts/`
  survive (default 20). Landed `tests/test_preserve_artifacts.py` with
  5 pytests pinning these invariants (rootfs skipped, oversize skipped,
  logs/session.db preserved, no-op when no failures, rotation keeps N).
- **`tests/capsem-security/test_binary_perms.py::test_agent_binaries_555`
  is green on macOS again.** `capsem-builder`'s container agent build
  runs `chmod 555 /output/<binary>` inside the build container
  (`src/capsem/builder/docker.py::container_compile_agent` line 444),
  but Docker-for-Mac bind-mount semantics let the 0o755 executable
  bits survive on the host side for `capsem-pty-agent` and
  `capsem-net-proxy` (capsem-mcp-server and capsem-sysutil came out
  0o555 cleanly -- same chmod, different result, macOS Docker
  filesystem weirdness). The initrd-pack recipe already re-applied
  `chmod 555` to its copies, but the on-disk `target/linux-agent/<arch>/`
  files remained 0o755, tripping the invariant check. Added an
  explicit `chmod 555 "$RELEASE_DIR"/{capsem-pty-agent,...}` step
  right after the `uv run capsem-builder agent` invocation in the
  `_pack-initrd` recipe so the invariant is enforced every time the
  build runs, regardless of what the container filesystem decides to
  preserve.
- **`just test-install` no longer passes dpkg-deb a two-path mess
  after a version bump.** The repack step did
  `DEB=$(ls /cargo-target/debug/bundle/deb/*.deb)` -- when the persistent
  `capsem-install-target` volume still held a previous version's `.deb`
  (e.g. today's `0.16.1` -> `1.0.1776688771` bump left the old file
  sitting next to the new one), the glob matched both and `$()`
  captured them joined by a newline. `build_system/packaging/linux/repack-deb.sh` then got
  one path-with-embedded-newline, which `dpkg-deb` tried to open as a
  single file and bailed with `No such file or directory`. Added
  `rm -f /cargo-target/debug/bundle/deb/*.deb` before the Tauri build
  so the bundle dir always starts empty, and switched the lookup to
  `ls -t ... | head -1` as belt-and-braces for the same class of
  bug.
- **Linux builds of `capsem-process` / `capsem-service` compile again.**
  Two sites in `crates/capsem-process/src/vsock.rs` called
  `capsem_core::hypervisor::apple_vz::run_on_main_thread(...)` inside
  the Stop and Suspend command handlers. The `apple_vz` module is
  gated on `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` (see
  `capsem-core/src/hypervisor/mod.rs:7`), so both sites broke
  `cargo build` on Linux with `cannot find 'apple_vz' in 'hypervisor'`
  -- surfaced by `just test-install`'s in-container
  `cargo build {{host_crates}}` step. Wrapped each call in
  `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` with a non-macOS branch that invokes
  the `VmHandle` methods directly; Apple VZ has a main-thread
  constraint (CFRunLoop) that KVM does not, and KVM's trait default
  returns "not supported" for `pause`/`save_state`, which `?`
  propagates -- the correct behaviour for a backend without
  checkpoint support. Also silenced `-D warnings` on
  `capsem-service::spawn_companions`'s `tray_bin` parameter, which is
  consumed only by the `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` tray-spawn block
  and therefore unused on Linux. Added
  `#[cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))] let _ = tray_bin;` to mark the
  intent without changing the cross-platform signature.
- **`just test-install` no longer dies with `Permission denied`
  when rustup tries to self-update.** Same root class as the
  `just cross-compile` EXDEV fix: the `capsem-install-test` image
  extends `capsem-host-builder` and inherits its `/usr/local/rustup`
  (root-owned from image build). The test-install recipe runs `cargo
  build` as the non-root `capsem` user, so rustup's
  channel-sync-on-first-cargo attempt to write
  `/usr/local/rustup/tmp/` is denied (`os error 13`). Added a
  dedicated `capsem-install-rustup:/usr/local/rustup` named-volume
  mount to the systemd-container `docker run`, added
  `/usr/local/rustup` to the chown pass, and added the volume to the
  `_clean-host-image` cleanup list. Mirrors the `capsem-rustup`
  pattern introduced for cross-compile; using a separate volume keeps
  the two images' rustup states from cross-contaminating if they ever
  drift to different stable channels.
- **`just test` / `just smoke` no longer hang on a pnpm interactive
  prompt.** The `_pnpm-install` helper ran `pnpm install
  --frozen-lockfile` with no `CI` env var, so whenever the on-disk
  `node_modules` store drifted from the lockfile (version bump, pnpm
  upgrade, stale npm artifacts, manual edits), pnpm asked `The
  modules directory at ... will be removed and reinstalled from
  scratch. Proceed? (Y/n)` on stdin and sat there forever in a
  non-interactive just-test run. Added `CI=true` to the invocation --
  same idiom already used in the cross-compile docker bash and the
  test-install container at lines 494 / 792 of the justfile -- which
  tells pnpm to auto-accept defaults instead of prompting.
- **`just cross-compile` no longer requires the release Tauri signing
  keys for dev builds.** The recipe read `private/tauri/capsem.key`
  and `private/tauri/password.txt` on the host and passed them to the
  container unconditionally. For any dev who doesn't have those files
  (everyone outside release CI), both env vars became empty strings,
  which Tauri 2 treats as "try to sign with an empty key" and aborts
  with `failed to decode secret key: incorrect updater private key
  password: Missing comment in secret key`. The real release keys are
  injected via GitHub Actions secrets (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` +
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` in
  `.github/workflows/release.yaml`); dev builds only need *a* valid
  key so `cargo tauri build` completes. Now the host only passes the
  signing env vars when both `private/tauri/capsem.key` and
  `private/tauri/password.txt` actually exist; otherwise the container
  generates a throwaway dev key into
  `/cargo-target/dev-tauri-private` (persistent across runs via the
  existing `capsem-host-target-<arch>` volume) with
  `cargo tauri signer generate --ci --force`. The generated key has a
  fixed password of `dev` -- its signatures are worthless for
  release-updater verification, but the bundle builds.
- **`just cross-compile` no longer dies with `Invalid cross-device link`
  when rustup self-updates inside the host-builder container.**
  `rust-toolchain.toml` pins `channel = "stable"`, so every time a new
  stable drops, the first cargo invocation inside the pre-built
  `capsem-host-builder` image triggers a rustup channel sync. The sync
  tries to `rename(2)` a toolchain directory
  (`toolchains/stable-.../lib/rustlib/.../self-contained`) from the
  image's lower overlay layer into `/usr/local/rustup/tmp/` on the
  container's upper layer; Docker-for-Mac's overlayfs bounces that
  specific cross-layer rename with `os error 18` and rustup aborts.
  Added a persistent `capsem-rustup:/usr/local/rustup` named-volume
  mount to the `docker run` in `cross-compile`, matching the same
  pattern used for `capsem-cargo-registry` / `capsem-cargo-git` /
  `capsem-host-target-<arch>`. First run copies the image's baked-in
  rustup tree into the volume; subsequent runs put all of rustup on
  one filesystem, so the rename stays within a single mount and the
  EXDEV class of bug is eliminated whether or not rustup self-updates.
  Updated `_clean-host-image` to rm the new volume and drop the
  never-wired `capsem-rustup-{arm64,x86_64}` placeholders.
- **`just test` and `just smoke` execution lock actually blocks
  concurrent runs now.** The lockfile lived at
  `$CAPSEM_RUN_DIR/execution.lock` under `$CAPSEM_HOME`, but the recipe
  ran `rm -rf "$CAPSEM_HOME"` *before* the `flock`. A second invocation
  therefore nuked the first's lockfile and created a new one; `flock -n
  3` on the new inode succeeded unchallenged (the first invocation's
  fd was pinned to the unlinked inode), so two `just test` or `just
  smoke` runs could race through the same `$CAPSEM_HOME`/shared-service
  path and trample each other's VMs. Moved the lockfile to
  `target/capsem-test-execution.lock` (outside `$CAPSEM_HOME`, survives
  the wipe) and acquired it *before* `rm -rf`. Extracted the
  mkdir/exec/flock dance into a single shell helper
  (`build_system/scripts/build/lib/exec_lock.sh::acquire_exec_lock`) and replaced all 8
  inline copies in the justfile (`dev`, `shell`, `run`, `test`,
  `smoke`, `build-gateway`, `bench`, `release`) with two-line
  `source + acquire_exec_lock <path>` calls. Added
  `build_system/tests/policy/test_exec_lock.py` (3 tests: concurrent blocker, reacquire
  after release, parent-dir creation) so this regression can't sneak
  back in.
- **`cargo test -p capsem-guard --lib` is deterministic again.** The
  `install_happy_path_returns_guards_and_creates_lock` test did
  `install -> drop -> install` in-process, which reliably failed under
  parallel `cargo test` because a sibling test
  (`singleton_reacquires_after_ungraceful_holder_exit`) calls
  `Command::spawn`, and the forked child briefly inherits our flock fd
  before exec'ing. `O_CLOEXEC` only closes on exec, not on fork; that
  window is enough for the kernel-level flock to survive our drop, so
  the second `install()` returns `Ok(None)` instead of `Ok(Some(_))`.
  This trap is already called out on
  `singleton_reacquires_after_drop_in_isolated_process`, which solves
  it by forking a clean subprocess for the drop-then-reacquire check;
  the new install_happy_path test quietly regressed that workaround.
  Removed the drop+re-install portion of the test -- its stated
  purpose (cover `install()`'s `Ok(Some(_))` arm and assert the
  lockfile exists) is preserved. llvm-cov on
  `capsem-guard/src/lib.rs` is unchanged to the region (714 / 37
  missed, 94.82%); the deleted lines duplicated coverage already
  carried by the isolated subprocess test.
- **Excluded `tests/capsem-build-chain/` from parallel pytest execution.** The suite runs `cargo build` and `codesign` via session-scoped fixtures, which caused races and failures on codesigning (`replacing existing signature` errors) when run concurrently with other tests. Now run in serial after the parallel block.
- **`capsem-process` now exits on `SIGTERM` on macOS.** Previously, the process blocked on `CFRunLoopRun()` and the signal handler task only logged the signal without stopping the run loop. Now, the signal handler calls `CFRunLoopStop` to allow the process to exit cleanly, fixing race conditions in VM cleanup tests.
- **MCP `shared_vm` consumers no longer intermittently 404 after
  `test_purge_all` runs on the same xdist worker.** `test_purge_all` was
  calling `capsem_purge { all: true }` on the session-scoped
  `capsem_service`, which also hosts the session-scoped `shared_vm`
  (persistent, named `shared-<worker>-<hex>`). Because `all=true`
  destroys every sandbox on the service -- persistent included -- any
  subsequent test on the same worker that used `shared_vm`
  (`test_sql_query`, `test_exec.*`, `test_file_io.*`, `test_lifecycle.*`,
  `test_mcp_call.*`) got `404 Not Found: sandbox not found` whenever
  pytest happened to schedule `test_purge_all` first. Fix: extracted the
  MCP conftest's service-startup into `_start_capsem_service()` so the
  `--gateway-port 0`, `--foreground`, `sign_binary`, and log-dumping
  invariants live in one place, added an `isolated_mcp_session`
  function-scoped fixture that spins up its own transient service for
  globally destructive tests, and migrated `test_purge_all` onto it.
  Added `test_isolated_mcp_session_does_not_affect_shared_service` to
  pin the isolation invariant so a future destructive test can't quietly
  regrow the same bug.
- **`capsem_mcp_call` no longer hangs for 60s on every invocation.** The
  service -> capsem-process IPC channel is `tokio-unix-ipc`, which uses
  bincode as its wire format. Bincode is not self-describing, and
  `serde_json::Value::deserialize` calls `deserialize_any`, which bincode
  explicitly rejects. `ServiceToProcess::McpCallTool { arguments:
  serde_json::Value }` therefore serialized fine on the service side and
  then failed to deserialize inside capsem-process the moment the message
  hit the wire -- the per-connection handler returned silently and the
  service's 60s `send_ipc_command` timeout fired. End result: every
  `tests/capsem-mcp/test_mcp_call.py` test spent exactly 60s hanging
  (120s combined, 75% of the 160s MCP parallel group), and the entire
  `capsem_mcp_call` feature path was dead on arrival on any non-stub
  aggregator. Fix: changed the IPC payload to JSON-stringified forms --
  `McpCallTool { arguments_json: String }` and
  `McpCallToolResult { result_json: Option<String> }` -- so the payload
  is opaque to bincode. The service and capsem-process now
  `serde_json::to_string` / `from_str` at the boundary. Added
  `mcp_call_tool_roundtrip_bincode` / `mcp_call_tool_result_roundtrip_bincode`
  tests in `capsem-proto` that exercise the real bincode path (the old
  tests only roundtripped through `serde_json::to_vec`, which is
  self-describing and missed the bug). MCP pytest group: 160s -> ~40s.
- **`capsem install` and `just install` can no longer bake a
  `target/test-home` path into the installed LaunchAgent / systemd unit.**
  `install_service()` resolves `--assets-dir` via
  `capsem_core::paths::capsem_assets_dir()`, which honors `CAPSEM_HOME` /
  `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR` / `CAPSEM_ASSETS_DIR`. If the installer inherited any
  of those from a prior `just test` session, the resulting LaunchAgent
  permanently referenced a directory that `just test` wipes on every
  run -- and with `KeepAlive=true`, launchd kept respawning it against a
  dead path, racing against `_ensure-service` during subsequent tests.
  Two-layer fix:
  - `install_service()` now bails with a clear message if any of the three
    isolation vars are set, telling the caller to `unset` them.
  - The `just install` recipe explicitly `unset`s them before running, so
    shells that accidentally still have them exported install cleanly.
  `build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py::_kill_dev_service` also switched from
  `pkill -f capsem-service.*--foreground` (which catches any installed
  LaunchAgent/systemd unit on the box) to a strict pidfile-based kill,
  mirroring the discipline `_ensure-service` already follows.
- **`capsem run` auto-launch now honors `CAPSEM_HOME`.** When the client
  couldn't reach the service socket it fell back to
  `launchctl kickstart` / `systemctl --user start` whenever a
  LaunchAgent / systemd unit existed. Those units point at the default
  `$HOME/.capsem` layout, so under an isolated test run
  (`CAPSEM_HOME=target/test-home/.capsem`) the kicked service bound a
  socket in the *real* home while the client kept polling the test home
  until the 5s `AwaitStartup` budget expired -- `build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py`'s
  ephemeral-model check always failed on machines with capsem installed.
  `UdsClient::try_ensure_service` now skips the service-manager branch
  whenever `CAPSEM_HOME` is set and goes straight to direct-spawn, so the
  child service inherits `CAPSEM_HOME` and binds the socket the client is
  watching. Production `~/.capsem` flow is unchanged.
- **Direct-spawn auto-launch no longer hangs the CLI's stdout/stderr
  pipes.** `UdsClient::try_ensure_service`'s fallback path spawned the
  service with inherited stdio, so when the CLI was invoked from Python
  under `subprocess.run(capture_output=True)`, the detached service
  kept stdout/stderr open long after the CLI returned. Python's
  `communicate()` waited for EOF on those pipes and always timed out at
  its outer 120s deadline -- the same symptom
  `build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py::check_persistence` hit under a test
  harness without an existing running service. The spawn now redirects
  all three fds to `/dev/null`; service logs still land in
  `<run_dir>/service.log` as before.
- **`_ensure-service` no longer leaks the execution-lock fd.** The
  backgrounded capsem-service inherited fd 3 (which holds `flock -n 3` on
  `$CAPSEM_RUN_DIR/execution.lock`) from its parent shell. If `just smoke`
  or `just test` aborted after starting the service, the service kept fd 3
  open and the flock stayed held after the outer shell exited, bricking
  subsequent runs with "another agent holds the test execution lock". The
  service is now launched with `3>&-` so fd 3 is closed before exec.
- **`just install` now leaves `~/.capsem/assets/` in the layout the service's
  resolver actually reads.** The .pkg/.deb ships only `manifest.json` (binaries
  and assets are on independent shipping cadences), and `capsem setup` was a
  stub with a TODO, so a fresh install left the UI banner stuck on "VM assets
  are missing" and every VM boot failed asset resolution. Added
  `build_system/scripts/build/sync-dev-assets.sh`, invoked by the `install` recipe after the
  installer runs, which mirrors the locally built `assets/$arch/*` hash-named
  files into `~/.capsem/assets/$arch/` (the exact paths
  `ManifestV2::resolve()` looks up) and removes the legacy `v1.0.*/`
  directories that accumulated from the old v1 layout. Also updated
  `build_system/scripts/test/simulate-install.sh` to honor the same layout so
  `tests/capsem_install/` agrees with production.

### Added
- **`capsem setup` actually downloads VM assets, and `capsem update --assets`
  re-fetches them on their own cadence.** New
  `capsem_core::asset_manager::download_missing_assets()` streams each arch's
  asset files from the GitHub release URL (per-arch upload names:
  `arm64-vmlinuz` / `arm64-initrd.img` / `arm64-rootfs.squashfs`),
  blake3-verifies the bytes, and places them at
  `$base/$arch/{hash_filename}` with 0o444 perms. `step_welcome` in the setup
  wizard, and a new `capsem update --assets` subcommand, both call into it.
  `CAPSEM_RELEASE_URL` env override lets integration tests redirect the
  download target.

### Tests
- **`tests/capsem_install/` is now safe to run bare-metal.** The module-level
  `CAPSEM_DIR` previously hardcoded `$HOME/.capsem`, so running
  `pytest tests/capsem_install/` clobbered the developer's real install
  (`simulate-install.sh` overwrote binaries; `test_full_uninstall` literally
  asserted `~/.capsem` was removed). `conftest.py` now provisions a temp
  `CAPSEM_HOME` for the session and auto-skips the `live_system` tier
  bare-metal unless `CAPSEM_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1`, because those tests invoke
  `capsem setup` / `capsem uninstall` which touch the system-level
  LaunchAgent / systemd unit outside any `CAPSEM_HOME` override.
  `test_installed_layout` was rewritten to assert the v2 layout
  (`$ASSETS/$arch/{hash_filename}`) instead of the legacy
  `$ASSETS/v$VERSION/` the resolver no longer reads.
  New `test_asset_download.py` covers the happy path, 404, hash mismatch,
  and idempotent rerun for `capsem update --assets` against a local HTTP
  fixture.

### Changed
- **`just test` and `just smoke` reordered for fail-fast feedback.** Audits,
  Rust lint, and the frontend suite now run in a single parallel block at the
  top of each recipe, so a bad Svelte type, a broken clippy lint, or a
  dependency advisory surfaces in under two minutes instead of after 5-10
  minutes of `cargo llvm-cov` and cross-compile. The lint gate switched from
  `cargo check --workspace` to
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, enforcing the
  project's stated bar (`CLAUDE.md`: "treat clippy and rustc warnings as
  build failures") with no duplicate compile (clippy is a strict superset of
  check). Smoke additionally gained `pnpm run check` in its parallel block --
  previously a Svelte/TS type error only surfaced under `just test`.
- **`just test` ignores `tests/capsem-recipes/` and `tests/capsem_install/`
  in its parallel pytest stage.** Both directories contain tests that
  `subprocess.run(["cargo", "build", ...])` from inside pytest; under `-n 4`
  this atomically replaced the codesigned `capsem-service` / `capsem-process`
  binaries while other xdist workers were booting VMs against them, hanging
  `just test` at 99%. The recipe tests are redundant inside `just test`
  (clippy + `cargo llvm-cov` + `_build-host` already cover their assertions)
  and remain runnable standalone via `uv run pytest -m recipe`. The install
  suite is fully covered by `just test-install` inside Docker.
- **Every Shiki grammar and theme is now a lazy chunk fetched on first
  use, and the heavy app views are code-split.** The app was importing
  `'shiki'` (the default `bundle-full` export), which references all
  235 Shiki languages -- Vite code-split every one, shipping >600 KB
  chunks for grammars we never use (emacs-lisp, wolfram, wasm,
  vue-vine, ...). Moved to `shiki/core` and swapped the Oniguruma WASM
  regex engine for `createJavaScriptRegexEngine()` (removes a 608 KB
  WASM-as-JS chunk; the JS engine covers every grammar we ship).
  `shiki.ts` now creates the highlighter with empty `langs` and
  `themes` arrays and exposes a single `highlightCode(code, lang,
  theme)` entry point plus `ensureShikiLang` / `ensureShikiTheme`
  helpers. Each of the 31 supported languages and 21 themes is a
  `() => import('@shikijs/langs/<name>')` entry, so Vite emits one
  chunk per grammar/theme; they are fetched the first time a matching
  file is rendered, then retained for the session. A `shikiTick`
  pattern in StatsView upgrades the plaintext fallback to highlighted
  HTML once the prewarm promise for its langs/theme resolves. In
  `App.svelte` the heavy views (Settings, Stats, Logs, ServiceLogs,
  Files, Inspector, OnboardingWizard, CreateSandboxDialog) are now
  loaded via `{#await import()}` so they're fetched only on first use.
  App chunk drops from 582 KB to 142 KB. `chunkSizeWarningLimit` is
  raised to 700 KB to accommodate the inherent ~620 KB cpp grammar
  chunk (loaded only for `.cpp`/`.hpp`/`.cc`/`.cxx`); every other
  chunk stays under 200 KB. `@shikijs/langs` and `@shikijs/themes` are
  now direct deps (previously transitive) so Vite can resolve the
  subpath imports.

### Fixed
- **`just test` no longer kills or mutates a locally installed capsem.**
  Previously the test harness (`build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py`,
  `_ensure-service`, and every Rust site that computed `$HOME/.capsem/...`
  directly) ran against the shared `~/.capsem/` directory, so a pkill-by-name
  on `capsem-service --foreground` took down the user's installed daemon,
  `~/.capsem/run/service.{sock,pid}` were deleted, and `~/.capsem/assets`
  was swapped for a symlink. Added a `CAPSEM_HOME` env var honored by a new
  `capsem_core::paths` module (with `capsem_run_dir`, `capsem_assets_dir`,
  `capsem_sessions_dir`, `capsem_bin_dir`, `capsem_logs_dir`,
  `service_socket_path`, `service_pidfile_path`) and routed every
  `$HOME/.capsem/...` site across `capsem`, `capsem-service`,
  `capsem-mcp`, `capsem-gateway`, `capsem-tray`, `capsem-app`, and
  `capsem-core` through it. `just test` / `just smoke` now export
  `CAPSEM_HOME=target/test-home/.capsem` (cleaned each run, swept by
  `just clean`). `_ensure-service` no longer uses pkill-by-name --
  it kills only the service tracked by its own pidfile, so an isolated
  test run never touches an installed daemon. The execution-lock flock
  moves into the test home alongside its socket.
- **Dev-build tray icon now renders orange** so the menu-bar icon is
  visually distinct from an installed release build. Grey pixels are
  recoloured to a `#FF8800` ramp at icon-load time under
  `cfg!(debug_assertions)`; anti-aliased edges remap by luminance so the
  icon stays smooth instead of banding. Release builds are untouched.
- **External links ("Get a key", API key docs, onboarding "Learn more")
  now open in the system browser from the Tauri desktop app.** Previously
  `<a target="_blank">` did nothing in the Tauri webview because
  `window.open` is a no-op there, and the `open_url` IPC handler already
  wired up in `capsem-app` was never called from the frontend. `openUrl()`
  in `api.ts` now detects the Tauri shell via `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` and
  invokes the `open_url` command; a document-level click interceptor in
  `App.svelte` routes every `<a target="_blank">` and `http(s):`/`mailto:`
  link through it, so existing call sites keep working unchanged. Browser
  dev mode still falls back to `window.open`.
- **Dark-mode warning banners no longer render with a white strip and
  unreadable text.** Two compounding issues: `html`/`body` had no
  theme-aware `background-color`, so the browser's default white canvas
  showed through any transparent element; and `--warning` /
  `--warning-foreground` were referenced across the frontend (install-
  incomplete banner, "VM assets are missing" alert, password-required
  badges, MCP section warnings) but never defined, so `bg-warning/10`
  resolved to fully transparent. Set the canvas to
  `var(--background)`/`var(--foreground)` on `html, body` and defined
  `--warning` (amber-600 light / amber-400 dark) plus
  `--warning-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark` so the amber tint and
  legible contrast appear on every warning surface.
- **`just install` no longer re-shows the GUI onboarding wizard on every
  reinstall.** The single `onboarding_completed` flag conflated "CLI install
  finished" with "user dismissed the welcome wizard", so dev reinstalls
  re-triggered the full-screen wizard even when the user had already clicked
  through it. Split into two flags: `install_completed` (set by `capsem setup`
  on success) and `onboarding_completed` (set only by the GUI wizard's "Get
  Started" button). Added `onboarding_version` to let a future release force
  re-onboarding by bumping `CURRENT_ONBOARDING_VERSION`. The frontend now reads
  a server-computed `needs_onboarding` instead of mirroring the version
  constant. Added `capsem setup --force-onboarding` to reset the wizard flags
  without wiping install state. Existing state files missing `install_completed`
  are migrated on load: if the `summary` step is present, install is inferred
  complete so upgraded users don't see a spurious "install didn't finish"
  banner. The app renders that banner only when `install_completed=false`,
  with a "Retry install" button that hits a new `POST /setup/retry` endpoint
  -- the service spawns `capsem setup --non-interactive --accept-detected` so
  users can recover from a broken install without opening a terminal.
- **`just smoke` now passes on dev machines whose user config opts
  into `security.web.allow_read=true`.** Three unrelated failures came
  out in the same wash:
  - Doctor `test_denied_domain_rejected` (test_network.py) and
    `test_denied_domain` (test_sandbox.py) hard-coded the default-deny
    posture. They now skip when `CAPSEM_WEB_ALLOW_READ=1` -- surfaced
    by injecting the `security.web.allow_{read,write}` toggles into
    the guest as `CAPSEM_WEB_ALLOW_{READ,WRITE}` env vars, the same
    pattern already used for `CAPSEM_OPENAI_ALLOWED` / etc. The
    policy's actual read/write denial is still exercised by
    `test_post_to_random_domain_denied`, which doesn't depend on the
    user's toggles.
  - `build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py` looked for `run-*` session
    directories; current `capsem-service` generates
    `tmp-<adj>-<noun>` IDs (see `generate_tmp_name`). Also relaxed
    the `~/.capsem/logs` check -- that directory only exists after
    the Tauri desktop shell has been launched, which integration_test
    never does. The script now only validates the logs if they're
    present.
  - `config/integration-test-user.toml` used the stale
    `network.custom_{allow,block}` / `network.default_action`
    setting IDs; migrated to current `security.web.*` keys so the
    deny list (`deny.example.com`) actually takes effect.
- **`build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py` restarts `capsem-service` with
  `CAPSEM_{USER,CORP}_CONFIG` in its env before booting the test VM**,
  then tears it down on exit. Required because the dev service
  (started by `_ensure-service`) inherits no test config, and
  `capsem run` talks to whatever service is already listening, so the
  per-VM policy previously fell back silently to `~/.capsem/user.toml`.
  Complements the service-side env passthrough in `refactor(service):
  extract pure helpers into lib + submodules`.

### Added
- **Failed-session log preservation for post-mortem.** Three host-side
  loss paths used to silently `remove_dir_all` the session directory
  when capsem-process died unexpectedly, taking `process.log`,
  `mcp-aggregator.stderr.log`, `serial.log`, and `session.db` with
  them -- exactly when those logs are most useful. All three now
  funnel through a single `ServiceState::preserve_failed_session_dir`
  helper that renames the dir to a `-failed-<ts>-<rand>` sibling
  (via `capsem_core::session::generate_session_id`) and calls
  `cull_failed_sessions` to cap the surviving count at
  `MAX_FAILED_SESSIONS = 5`. If rename fails (EEXIST, permission,
  cross-filesystem), `warn!` with the specific error and fall back
  to `remove_dir_all` so disk isn't leaked when the filesystem is
  already unhappy. Paths wired through the helper:
  (a) `handle_run`'s `wait_for_vm_ready` timeout -- now also awaits
  `wait_for_process_exit` before rename so the child has finished
  flushing session.db and log files (avoids the path-based-reopen
  ENOENT hazard during shutdown);
  (b) `scrub_evicted_instance` (promoted from free fn to
  `ServiceState` method) when `cleanup_stale_instances` detects a
  dead PID -- the loss path the last service commit introduced;
  (c) `provision_sandbox`'s child-exit handler, which fires only
  when the child died outside the explicit teardown path
  (`shutdown_vm_process` removes the map entry first, so the
  `removed = Some(info)` branch is by definition the "died
  unexpectedly" case). Four new unit tests pin the contract: rename
  preserves file contents, cull keeps newest and prunes oldest, cull
  is a no-op under the cap, cull never touches non-`-failed-` dirs.
- **Multi-agent execution lock on heavy `just` recipes.** `smoke`,
  `test`, `bench`, `shell`, `exec`, `ui`, `install`, and
  `test-gateway-e2e` now acquire a non-blocking `flock(1)` on
  `~/.capsem/run/execution.lock` before doing anything that touches
  the shared `capsem-service`. A second agent attempting a heavy
  recipe while one is in flight gets an immediate
  `"another agent holds the capsem execution lock ..."` error instead
  of silently restarting the service under the first agent's VMs.
  The kernel releases the lock when the holding process exits, so
  there are no stale lockfiles on crash/SIGKILL. `flock` is now
  checked by `just doctor` (hints point at `brew install flock` on
  macOS, `util-linux` on Linux) and auto-installed by
  `bootstrap.sh` on macOS when Homebrew is available.

### Changed
- **`UdsClient::connect_with_timeout` now uses
  `capsem_core::poll::poll_until`** instead of a hand-rolled
  exponential-backoff loop. New `ConnectMode { FailFast, AwaitStartup }`
  parameter makes the retryable-vs-permanent classification explicit
  at every call site: the initial probe in `request()` stays
  `FailFast` so CLI calls don't sit for 5 s when the service is
  definitively down; post-launch retries in `try_ensure_service` are
  `AwaitStartup` so a just-started service's `ENOENT`/`ConnectionRefused`
  are treated as "socket not bound yet" rather than "service dead."
  Also folded: `try_ensure_service` now returns the connected
  `UnixStream` so `request()` no longer does a third redundant
  connect. Net effect on the code is smaller than the diff suggests --
  mostly deletes the hand-rolled state machine and replaces it with
  the shared primitive. See `/dev-rust-patterns` lesson 19 and
  `/dev-bug-review` (the skill now explicitly calls out
  "grep for existing primitives, don't hand-roll" as a first-class
  step of the workflow).
- **`capsem-service` split into `lib + bin`** -- new `crates/capsem-service/src/lib.rs` exposes the `api`, `errors`, `fs_utils`, and `naming` submodules. Pure helpers (`AppError`, `sanitize_file_path`, `extract_magika_info`, `identify_file_sync`, `validate_vm_name`, `generate_tmp_name`) move out of `main.rs` into their own files with their own `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. `ServiceState`, `PersistentRegistry`, `resolve_workspace_path`, and every axum handler stay in `main.rs` (their move is a follow-up sprint). `api.rs` content is unchanged -- `errors.rs` re-exports `ErrorResponse` via `pub use`. +14 net new unit tests; `errors.rs`/`fs_utils.rs`/`naming.rs` each at 100% line, region, and function coverage. Unblocks future `crates/capsem-service/tests/` integration tests now that `lib.rs` exists.
- **Workspace MSRV bumped from Rust 1.82 to 1.91.** `capsem-core`'s
  `mcp::builtin_tools` relies on `str::floor_char_boundary`, stable in
  1.91, which clippy's `incompatible_msrv` lint correctly flagged.
  Raising the floor clears the lint (no downgrade path), matches the
  toolchain the tree is actually built with, and unblocks
  `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` across the workspace.

### Fixed
- **`capsem doctor` (and any other auto-launch path) no longer
  spuriously fails with "Service manager started capsem but socket not
  ready."** Root cause: `UdsClient::connect_with_timeout` fast-failed
  on `ENOENT`/`ConnectionRefused` from its very first attempt, breaking
  out of its own retry loop before the just-requested service could
  bind its socket. The obvious symptom was the misleading error
  message; the less obvious consequence was that the auto-launch
  path became racy under load and flaky in tests. Fix is the
  `ConnectMode`-aware refactor above plus preserving the inner error
  via `Context` instead of the old `.map_err(|_| anyhow!(...))` which
  threw the real `io::Error::kind` away. Pre-existing clippy cleared
  in the same file: 3 `print_literal` on table-header printlns
  (intentional literal labels -- allowed locally with a comment),
  3 `field_reassign_with_default` in `setup.rs` test fixtures.
  Regression tests in `client.rs`: FailFast short-circuits in under
  500 ms on a missing socket; AwaitStartup sees a `UnixListener`
  bound 400 ms after the connect call starts; AwaitStartup times out
  cleanly with a preserved error chain when nothing ever binds.

### Added
- **Host-side logs now carry `vm_id` and `trace_id` as structured
  fields for cross-process correlation.** `capsem-process` generates a
  16-hex-char `trace_id` at startup and enters a root
  `info_span!("vm", vm_id, trace_id)` that every subsequent log line
  inherits. The same pair is propagated to the aggregator subprocess
  via `CAPSEM_VM_ID` / `CAPSEM_TRACE_ID` env vars, and
  `capsem-mcp-aggregator` enters a matching
  `info_span!("aggregator", vm_id, trace_id)`. Grep for a `trace_id` to
  follow a single VM's execution across `process.log`,
  `mcp-aggregator.stderr.log`, and `session.db` in the same session
  directory. First step toward broader log correlation -- other
  binaries (service, gateway, app) will pick up the same pair in
  follow-ups. OpenTelemetry export was proposed alongside this and
  explicitly deferred to a sprint proposal: it's a feature, it adds
  a new outbound channel to an air-gapped product, and the
  correlation problem that motivated it is solved by `trace_id`
  alone.

### Fixed
- **`capsem-mcp-aggregator` stderr no longer pollutes `process.log`.**
  `capsem-process` spawned the aggregator with
  `Stdio::inherit()` for stderr, so the aggregator's plain-text
  tracing merged into the parent's JSON tracing stream and made
  `process.log` effectively unparseable with `jq` / log pipelines.
  Two coupled fixes: (a) the aggregator's subscriber now uses
  `.json()`, matching `capsem-process` and `capsem-service`; (b) the
  aggregator's stderr is now redirected to a dedicated
  `mcp-aggregator.stderr.log` in the VM's session directory, opened
  with `0o600` under `#[cfg(unix)]` per
  `/dev-rust-patterns` lesson 14. End state: `process.log` is pure
  parent JSON, `mcp-aggregator.stderr.log` is pure aggregator JSON.
  Also elevated a small set of lifecycle events from `debug` to
  `info` (aggregator reader/writer/monitor task start/stop,
  `mcp::gateway::serve_mcp_session_inner` EOF) so critical
  lifecycle transitions are always visible in the default filter.
  Cleared 4 pre-existing clippy errors in `capsem-process` that the
  gate surfaced: one `too_many_arguments` on `ipc::handle_ipc_connection`
  (8 > 7 -- `#[allow(...)]` with no behavior change), three
  `useless_vec` in unit tests. Three new unit tests pin the
  `trace_id` contract (16 hex chars, no collisions over 64 calls)
  and the aggregator-log path (lives in session dir). The JSON
  format switch and the root-span wiring are not cleanly unit
  testable without a live subscriber harness; validated via compile
  + clippy + existing suites.
- **`capsem-app`'s update-prompt no longer blocks a tauri/tokio worker
  thread while the user decides.** `check_for_update_with_prompt` in
  `crates/capsem-app/src/main.rs` used `tauri_plugin_dialog`'s
  `.blocking_show()` from inside an `async fn` spawned on the runtime.
  Because the user can leave the dialog sitting for seconds to minutes,
  the blocked thread effectively holds a runtime worker for human time
  -- same anti-pattern we just fixed in the tray (`std::process::Command`
  in async). The fix is NOT `spawn_blocking` (its bounded pool is sized
  for short I/O, not human waits); it's bridging the plugin's
  callback-based `.show(|accepted| ...)` to async via
  `tokio::sync::oneshot`. See `/dev-rust-patterns` "Blocking-in-async
  anti-pattern" and `/dev-bug-review`.
- **`capsem-app` session log now created with mode `0o600`.** The
  per-launch log at `~/.capsem/logs/<timestamp>.jsonl` was opened via
  `File::create`, which applies the user's umask (typically `0644`) and
  leaves the file readable by every local user. The log contains
  tracing spans with VM ids, filesystem paths, provider API metadata,
  and tool-call arguments -- on a shared box that is a user-to-user
  information leak. Factored an `open_log_file(path)` helper that uses
  `OpenOptions::mode(0o600)` under `#[cfg(unix)]` with a plain-options
  fallback elsewhere, matching the established pattern already used by
  `pty_log.rs`, the gateway auth token, per-VM sockets, and
  `capsem-core`'s key helpers. Two new unit tests pin the behavior
  (file round-trips content; mode is exactly `0o600` on Unix). Also
  cleared a pre-existing `needless_borrows_for_generic_args` clippy on
  the deep-link `window.eval` call in the same file. See
  `/dev-rust-patterns` lesson 14.
- **`provision_sandbox` no longer holds the `instances` mutex across
  blocking filesystem work, and no longer probes for stale records on
  every successful provision.** `cleanup_stale_instances` previously
  held the std::sync::Mutex from the `kill(pid, 0)` probe loop all the
  way through the `remove_dir_all` + `remove_file` sweep for every
  evicted ephemeral session -- hundreds of ms of blocking I/O under
  which every other `instances.lock()` caller (~30 sites: list /
  status / stop / delete / suspend / resume / fork / exec handlers)
  stalled. Split into a two-phase contract: `drain_dead_instances`
  probes and evicts under the lock (microseconds), and the caller
  scrubs each evicted entry's filesystem artifacts via the free
  `scrub_evicted_instance` with the lock released. Additionally gated
  the probe itself: `provision_sandbox` now only runs it when
  `instances.contains_key(id)` or the map is already at
  `max_concurrent_vms` -- the two conditions under which stale
  reclamation could unblock the caller. Three regression tests pin
  the drain contract (dead-only eviction, no-op when all alive, mutex
  released on return). Follow-up to commit 34d0e3f.
- **`POST /run` no longer blocks the tokio reactor on provision.**
  `handle_run` at `crates/capsem-service/src/main.rs:2484` was calling
  `state.provision_sandbox(...)` directly from the axum async handler,
  missed by commit 34d0e3f's spawn_blocking sweep that covered
  `handle_provision` and `handle_fork`. Same blocking I/O
  (APFS clonefile, `rootfs.img` fsync, walkdir, subprocess spawn),
  same fix -- wrap in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` with the runtime-
  handle thread-local preserved for the inner
  `tokio::process::Command::spawn`.
- **Cleared 18 pre-existing clippy errors surfaced by running
  `-D warnings` across the provision path's dependency graph:** 3 in
  `capsem-service/main.rs` (two `u64 as u64` casts in
  `attach_summary_telemetry`, one `iter_kv_map` in the MCP refresh
  broadcast), 6 in `capsem-core/asset_manager.rs` (five `iter_kv_map`,
  one `collapsible_if` in the asset-version resolver), 1 in
  `capsem-core/setup_state.rs` (field reassignment after
  `Default::default()` in a unit test), 1 `incompatible_msrv`
  (addressed via the MSRV bump above), 4 redundant closures + 3
  redundant `+ 0` operands in `capsem-logger/reader.rs` test fixtures.
  None were behavioral; the redundant-closure fixes convert
  `|row| read_*_row(row)` to `read_*_row`.
- **`just test` no longer self-destructs across parallel workers from a
  broad `pkill`.** Four sites fired `pkill -9 -x capsem-service` (or
  `-f capsem-service`) which matched every `capsem-service` on the box,
  including every other pytest-xdist worker's test service. A single
  install-tests fixture running `simulate-install.sh` took the whole suite
  down -- reproducibly -- pushing ~148 tests into "service refused
  connection" / "VM never exec-ready" cascades. Each site now scopes the
  match to its own install prefix:
  - `build_system/scripts/test/simulate-install.sh` matches `$INSTALL_DIR/<name>`.
  - `tests/capsem_install/conftest.py::_kill_service` matches
    `$INSTALL_DIR/<name>`.
  - `tests/capsem_install/test_service_install.py` matches
    `$INSTALL_DIR/capsem-service`.
  - `crates/capsem/src/uninstall.rs` and
    `crates/capsem/src/service_install.rs` use `current_exe().parent()` to
    scope `pkill` to the binary's own install directory -- semantically
    also correct in production: `capsem uninstall` from `~/.capsem/bin`
    only affects processes launched from `~/.capsem/bin`, leaving dev
    services under `target/debug/` alone.
- **Gateway tests now pass their parent PID.** `tests/helpers/gateway.py`
  spawned `capsem-gateway` without `--parent-pid`, so `capsem-guard`
  returned `Err(NoParent)` and the gateway exited 0 immediately. Every
  gateway fixture then failed its 10s readiness wait and every gateway
  test (60+ errors, ~10 failures) cascade-failed at setup. Helper now
  passes `--parent-pid=os.getpid()` and `--run-dir` so the per-test
  singleton lock lands in the test tmp dir.
- **Built-in MCP snapshot tools: `snapshots_history` dropped its `path`
  argument and `snapshots_compact` dropped its `name` argument** because
  `SnapshotPaginationParams` / `SnapshotCompactParams` in
  `crates/capsem-mcp-builtin/src/main.rs` didn't declare those fields.
  rmcp's typed-parameter deserialiser silently discarded the unknown
  keys, so every `snapshots_history` call returned
  `-32602 missing 'path' argument`. Added a dedicated
  `SnapshotHistoryParams` struct and extended `SnapshotCompactParams`.
  Also renamed `SnapshotCheckpointParams` → `SnapshotRevertParams` with
  `path: String` required and `checkpoint: Option<String>` optional
  (matches `handle_revert_file`'s auto-pick-newest behaviour).
- **Built-in MCP tool failures are now `isError: true` on the result
  instead of a success-shaped result containing error text.**
  `extract_text` in `capsem-mcp-builtin` returned
  `Ok(text)` for every tool response, including the ones where
  `call_builtin_tool` had set `isError: true`. rmcp maps `Err(String)`
  to the wire-level `isError` result, so blocked-domain and
  invalid-URL rejections from `fetch_http` / `grep_http` / `http_headers`
  went through as regular successes. Now propagated correctly.
- **Three built-in HTTP tools carry MCP annotations.** Added
  `annotations(title, read_only_hint, destructive_hint, idempotent_hint,
  open_world_hint)` to `fetch_http`, `grep_http`, `http_headers` so their
  `tools/list` output matches the file-tool annotations the MCP spec
  expects clients to surface.
- **Guest `snapshots` CLI calls now use namespaced tool names.** The
  in-VM `snapshots` helper in `guest/artifacts/snapshots` called
  `snapshots_create`/`_list`/`_revert`/`_delete`/`_history`/`_compact`
  against the host MCP gateway, which namespaces aggregator tools as
  `{server}__{tool}` -- so every bare call returned
  `-32603 tool call failed` and every `snapshots …` command inside the
  VM died with the capsem-mcp-server stderr bleeding into the CLI
  error. Prefixed each call with `local__`. See
  `crates/capsem-core/src/mcp/types.rs::namespace_name` and the `local`
  key in `config/defaults.json`.
- **Tray no longer flashes the menu bar during tests.** Added
  `CAPSEM_TRAY_HEADLESS` env var to `capsem-tray` -- when set, the
  binary still arms parent-watch and acquires the singleton flock but
  skips `NSStatusItem` / `TrayIconBuilder` creation and idles. The
  integration test helpers (`tests/helpers/service.py`,
  `tests/capsem-mcp/conftest.py`) no longer pass `--tray-binary` at all;
  the tray-focused `tests/capsem-service/test_companion_lifecycle.py`
  keeps spawning the tray but in headless mode. Full-suite runs now
  create zero menu-bar icons.
- **In-VM diagnostic test suite realigned to current product behaviour.**
  `guest/artifacts/diagnostics/test_mcp.py` and `test_network.py` had a
  cluster of stale assertions: tool names without the `local__`
  namespace prefix that the gateway applies, the four
  `pytest.raises(AssertionError)` blocks that were only catching the
  "tool not found" protocol error (now that the tools are found and
  exercise real error paths), `mcpServers["capsem"]` instead of the
  canonical `["local"]` key from `config/defaults.json`, `fetch_http` /
  `grep_http` / `http_headers` expecting `{"isError": true}` where the
  host code was returning a success result containing error text,
  `list_changed_files` expected in `tools/list` (renamed to
  `snapshots_changes`), and `test_denied_domain_rejected` using
  `api.openai.com` which is policy-gated by `CAPSEM_OPENAI_ALLOWED`
  (returns 401 when enabled, not the 403 the test wanted).
  Introduced `ns()` / `_init_and_call` auto-prefix + `_assert_tool_error`
  helpers; `_init_and_call` now collapses JSON-RPC errors into
  `isError: true` tool results so callers see a single shape regardless
  of where the failure originated.
- **`tests/capsem-stress/test_rapid_exec.py::test_rapid_file_io` hit a
  404 on every iteration.** The test POSTed to `/write-file/{id}` and
  `/read-file/{id}` (dashes) but the service routes are `/write_file/`
  and `/read_file/` (underscores); it also sent `data: list[int]` bytes
  where the endpoint expects `content: str`. Fixed.

### Added
- **`capsem-guard` crate** -- new tiny library (`crates/capsem-guard/`) with
  parent-watch + singleton flock primitives. Used by `capsem-gateway` and
  `capsem-tray` to make them non-standalone companions of `capsem-service`:
  they refuse to start without a valid `--parent-pid`, acquire a system-wide
  singleton lock, and self-exit within 100 ms when the parent dies. Works
  under SIGKILL, OOM, and pytest-xdist worker death -- scenarios where
  `tokio::process::Command::kill_on_drop(true)` silently does nothing.
  Implementation details: `getppid()`-based watcher (immune to zombie state),
  `O_CLOEXEC`-atomic `flock(2)` with a process-local registry to cover the
  fork-to-exec window, global tray lock at `~/.capsem/run/tray.lock` (one
  menu-bar icon system-wide). 31 Rust unit tests + 15 adversarial Python
  integration tests in `tests/capsem-service/test_companion_lifecycle.py`
  (refuse-standalone × 4, singleton × 3 incl. 20-way hammer, dies-with-parent
  × 2, service-SIGKILL end-to-end × 1, timing-budget regression guards × 5).
  See `/dev-rust-patterns` lesson 18.

### Fixed
- **Tray action dispatch no longer stalls its tokio worker on fork/exec.**
  `launch_ui` and `launch_ui_action` in `crates/capsem-tray/src/main.rs`
  called `std::process::Command::spawn` synchronously from the async
  `dispatch_action` path. Because the tray runs a `new_current_thread`
  tokio runtime (one worker), each Connect / New Session / Save / Fork
  click briefly froze status polling and further action dispatch during
  the `posix_spawn`/`fork+exec` syscall. Swapping to
  `tokio::process::Command` would not have helped -- its `spawn()` still
  invokes the same blocking syscall. Both launches now run on a
  dedicated `std::thread::spawn` (not `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, whose
  bounded worker pool is the wrong fit for the reaper's long
  `Child::wait()`) and the child is now reaped, eliminating zombie
  accumulation on the long-lived tray process. Deduped the two
  near-identical launch bodies behind `find_capsem_app_binary` + a pure
  `build_launch_invocation` helper, covered by 6 new unit tests pinning
  deep-link construction for the direct-binary and `open -a Capsem`
  fallback paths. Also fixed a `clippy::redundant_closure` around
  `tray_lock_path`. See `/dev-rust-patterns` "Blocking-in-async
  anti-pattern" and `/dev-bug-review`.
- **`POST /fork/{id}` and `POST /sandboxes` (provision) no longer block
  the tokio reactor during heavy filesystem work.** `handle_fork` called
  `capsem_core::auto_snapshot::clone_sandbox_state` directly from the axum
  handler; `handle_provision` called the synchronous
  `ServiceState::provision_sandbox`, which wraps the same clone plus a
  `sync_all()` flush of `rootfs.img` and a walkdir-based `disk_usage_bytes`.
  Under concurrent fork/provision load these could exhaust axum worker
  threads and stall unrelated requests. Both call sites are now wrapped in
  `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, matching the established pattern in the
  same file (`handle_upload`, `list_dir_recursive`, `handle_detect_host_config`,
  the `remove_dir_all` cleanups). The sync-to-spawn_blocking handoff
  preserves the tokio runtime handle via thread-locals, so the
  `tokio::process::Command::spawn` call inside `provision_sandbox` still
  works. All 116 capsem-service tests remain green.
- **AI traffic parsers no longer build a full JSON DOM for tool call args
  and responses.** Three places in `crates/capsem-core/src/net/ai_traffic/`
  parsed LLM SSE payloads into `serde_json::Value` only to stringify them
  (Gemini `functionCall.args` in `google.rs`, Gemini `functionResponse.response`
  in `request_parser.rs`) or not use them at all (OpenAI Responses API
  `ResponseInfo.output`). Switched the two stringified sites to
  `Box<serde_json::value::RawValue>` so the fragment is kept as a lazy byte
  slice and re-emitted verbatim without an intermediate `BTreeMap`/`Vec` DOM
  allocation; deleted the unused OpenAI `output` field entirely. Enabled the
  workspace `serde_json` `raw_value` feature. Added two regression tests
  (`stream_function_call_preserves_arg_bytes_verbatim`,
  `google_function_response_preserves_bytes_verbatim`) pinning the byte-
  verbatim preservation behavior -- RawValue keeps whitespace and key order
  as-sent, where `Value` would re-serialize to canonical-compact form. See
  `/dev-rust-patterns` lesson 6.
- **Companion processes no longer leak across interrupted test runs.**
  `just test -n 4` under ctrl-C / pytest-xdist worker death / SIGKILL left
  `capsem-gateway` and `capsem-tray` reparented to PID 1 because their only
  cleanup hook was `kill_on_drop(true)`, which does not fire on ungraceful
  exit. Accumulated orphans caused downstream "vm-ready never asserted"
  poll spins, UDS connection refusals, and the suspend/resume regression.
  Fixed by wiring all companions through the new `capsem-guard` library;
  the contract is enforced on the companion side so the spawner can't get
  it wrong.

### Changed
- **Linux CI now measures coverage for every portable host crate.** The
  `llvm-cov nextest --codecov` invocation on the KVM runner previously
  tested only 8 of 14 workspace members. Added `capsem-agent` (118 tests),
  `capsem-gateway` (128), `capsem-process` (72), and `capsem-guard` (31)
  -- none of which had macOS-only code paths gating their Linux build.
  The only crates still excluded from Linux CI are `capsem-app` (Tauri
  shell) and `capsem-tray` (`muda` menu-bar), both genuinely macOS-only.
  Net effect: ~349 additional Rust tests now contribute to the Codecov
  dashboard from the Linux side, catching Linux-specific regressions the
  macOS run cannot. Added a new `Guard` component to `codecov.yml` so the
  crate shows up alongside Gateway, Service, CLI, etc.

### Fixed
- **`just ui` / `just shell` re-invocation no longer leaves the dev service
  without a gateway.** Three related bugs in the companion-shutdown path
  collectively caused the new gateway to hit `EADDRINUSE` on port 19222
  whenever the prior dev service was killed (SIGTERM or SIGKILL) and a
  new one spawned within `_ensure-service`'s 500 ms restart budget. User
  symptom: the frontend WebSocket connected briefly (served by the
  orphan gateway), then dropped when the orphan's parent-watch fired,
  after which every reconnect hit "connection refused". Each bug has a
  dedicated regression test in `tests/capsem-service/test_companion_lifecycle.py`.
  - `capsem-service` killed VMs *before* companions on graceful shutdown.
    `kill_all_vm_processes` includes an unconditional 500 ms SIGTERM-grace
    `thread::sleep`, so companion-kill didn't run until at least 500 ms
    after SIGTERM -- exactly when the new service was spawning its own
    gateway. Fixed by reordering graceful_shutdown to kill companions
    first. Guard: `TestServiceSigtermReapsCompanionsPromptly` (300 ms
    budget).
  - `kill_all_vm_processes` slept 500 ms *even when zero VMs were
    running*, inflating every shutdown by half the `_ensure-service`
    budget. Fixed by early-returning when the VM list is empty and
    skipping the grace sleep when no VM was actually signalled. Guard:
    `TestServiceShutdownIsFastWithoutVMs` (300 ms full shutdown budget).
  - `capsem-guard`'s parent-watch polled every 500 ms, so a SIGKILL'd
    service's companions could remain alive up to a full poll interval --
    the full `_ensure-service` budget by itself. Tightened
    `PARENT_POLL_INTERVAL` from 500 ms to 100 ms (`getppid()` is a vDSO
    call; cost is negligible). Guard: `TestCompanionsDieFastAfterServiceSigkill`
    (300 ms budget on SIGKILL path). Also documents an end-to-end
    restart contract in `TestServiceRestartSequenceKeepsGatewayHealthy`.

- **`just _clean-stale` no longer hangs for minutes.** The bash body called
  `lsof -tU "$s"` once per socket in `/tmp/capsem/*.sock`. On macOS each call
  scans every process's FD table (~200 ms), so after ~1700 dead sockets
  accumulated the loop took ~6 minutes and made `just test` / `just smoke` /
  `just install` / `just build-assets` look stuck. Replaced the entire recipe
  with `build_system/scripts/build/clean_stale.py`, which probes socket liveness via
  `socket.connect()` (~4 us per socket, ~50000x faster) and ports the other
  stages (stale rootfs/`_up_` dirs, stale test fixtures, cargo artifact
  age-prune) to Python. Measured: 1772 orphan sockets + 926 stale cargo dirs
  cleaned in 3.2 s total; steady-state second run 1.3 s. Covered by 16 pytest
  cases in `tests/capsem-cleanup-script/` including a 2000-socket perf guard
  that fails if the regression ever returns.

- **`just test -n 4` concurrency cascade** -- four independent bugs surfaced as
  "flaky tests" whenever pytest ran with parallel workers. Collapsed the cascade
  from ~130 test failures down to ~5.
  - **`capsem-service` is now self-idempotent on startup.** New
    `crates/capsem-service/src/startup.rs` probes `/version` on the target UDS
    and an adjacent advisory flock serialises the probe→remove-stale→bind
    critical section. Four parallel `capsem-service --uds-path X` invocations
    converge on exactly one running service; losers exit 0 when the version
    matches, exit non-zero on mismatch (never auto-kill).
  - **`capsem-gateway` honours the service's `run_dir`.** New `--run-dir` flag
    (plus `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR` env fallback) replaces the `$HOME/.capsem/run`
    hardcode. The service passes it when spawning the gateway child, so
    `gateway.{token,port,pid}` land where the service polls for them. The
    gateway also writes `gateway.port` *after* `TcpListener::bind` so
    OS-assigned ports (`--gateway-port 0`) are recorded correctly instead of
    persisting the configured `0`.
  - **`axum::serve` no longer blocks on `gateway-ready`.** `spawn_companions`
    ran inline before `axum::serve`, delaying UDS accept by up to 5 s per
    startup while polling for `gateway.token`. Companion spawning is now
    detached via `tokio::spawn`, so the UDS accepts the instant it binds.
    Companion children are parked in a `Mutex<Vec<Child>>` and explicitly
    killed on graceful shutdown (kill_on_drop handles crash paths).
  - **CLI `run_dir` derives from `--uds-path`.** When `--uds-path` is explicit
    (tests, custom deployments), `crates/capsem/src/main.rs` now takes the
    parent directory as `run_dir` instead of falling back to
    `CAPSEM_RUN_DIR`/`$HOME`. Keeps doctor logs and inherited paths consistent
    with wherever the service actually writes.
- **`ProvisionResponse.uds_path` is the source of truth for instance sockets.**
  Clients were recomputing `<run_dir>/instances/{id}.sock`, but the service
  falls back to `/tmp/capsem/<hash>.sock` when the preferred path exceeds
  macOS's 104-byte `SUN_LEN`. The fallback hash uses process-randomised
  `DefaultHasher`, so clients *cannot* reliably recompute. The provision
  response now includes the server-chosen path; `capsem doctor` uses it
  directly (fixes "Session did not become ready within 30s" on e2e tests
  rooted under `/var/folders/...`).

### Changed
- **Shared `capsem_core::uds` module** -- extracted `SUN_PATH_MAX` and
  `instance_socket_path` into `crates/capsem-core/src/uds.rs` so the
  SUN-length workaround lives in exactly one place. Service delegates; clients
  use it as a fallback only when talking to a pre-`uds_path` service.
- **`capsem doctor` uses the shared poll helper** -- the hand-rolled
  `loop { if sock.exists() ... sleep 200ms }` waiting for the per-VM IPC
  channel was replaced with `capsem_core::poll::poll_until`, same primitive
  already used by CLI/service/MCP.

### Changed
- **Crate `capsem-ui` renamed to `capsem-app`** -- crate and binary name now match the directory. Tauri identifier (`com.capsem.capsem`), productName (`Capsem`), and code-signing/notarization are unaffected. `justfile`, CI workflow, `capsem-tray` binary path lookups, `capsem-build-chain` tests, and the relevant skills were updated. localStorage keys `capsem-ui-mode` / `capsem-ui-font-size` were intentionally left unchanged to preserve user preferences across upgrades.
- **Workspace Cargo metadata** -- `[workspace.package]` now carries `description`, `license = "Apache-2.0"`, `repository`, `homepage`, `rust-version`, and `authors`; every per-crate `Cargo.toml` inherits via `.workspace = true`. `cargo metadata` consumers (SBOM, GitHub dep graph, cargo-deny) now see canonical values for all 13 crates.
- **Skills drift reconciled** -- `/dev-capsem` crate map no longer has the duplicate `capsem-gateway` row and now lists `capsem-mcp-aggregator` and `capsem-mcp-builtin`. `/dev-mcp` tool table drops three tools that no longer exist (`capsem_image_list/inspect/delete`), adds `capsem_mcp_servers`, `capsem_mcp_tools`, `capsem_mcp_call`, and documents the three-crate MCP subprocess architecture. CLAUDE.md project layout now lists all 13 crates and the skills table matches `skills/` on disk.

### Added
- **`SECURITY.md`** -- vulnerability reporting policy (GitHub Security Advisories), supported versions, disclosure timeline, scope (sandbox escape, MITM bypass, supply-chain integrity) and explicit out-of-scope (anything inside the guest VM by design).
- **`RELEASE.md`** -- human-facing pre/post-release checklist that points back to `/release-process` for depth. Captures the `just cut-release` path, CI pipeline shape, and what to check after the tag is pushed.
- **`rust-toolchain.toml`** -- pins the stable channel + `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` / `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` targets so local and CI builds resolve the same toolchain.
- **`web/docs/usage/mcp-tools.md`** -- user-facing reference for the 22 MCP tools exposed by `capsem-mcp`, grouped by session lifecycle, exec/file, telemetry, MCP aggregator, and diagnostics. Source of truth remains `crates/capsem-mcp/src/main.rs`.
- **`web/docs/usage/shell-completions.md`** -- how to generate and install bash/zsh/fish/PowerShell completions via `capsem completions <shell>`.
- **Pointer READMEs at `crates/capsem/README.md` and `crates/capsem-proto/README.md`** -- ~10-line README each for the two externally-visible crates, linking to capsem.org.

### Added
- **capsem/setup.rs tests + small DI refactor** -- helpers (`load_state`, `save_state`, each `step_*`) now take `capsem_dir: &Path` explicitly instead of reading it from `$HOME` at call time. `run_setup` still computes the real dir once and threads it through, so the public contract is unchanged. 11 new unit tests cover state-file roundtrip (including atomic overwrite + parent-dir creation), corrupt-state recovery, and `step_corp_config` success / invalid-TOML / missing-file paths against a `tempdir()`. `setup.rs` coverage 0% → 47%.
- **Unit tests for capsem-app helpers** -- `parse_flag`, `cleanup_old_logs`, `format_log_filename` (extracted from `log_filename` for testability). 12 new tests covering the deep-link argument parser and log housekeeping.
- **HTTP-level tests for capsem-tray gateway client** -- new `spawn_http_probe` test helper spins up a single-connection `tokio::net::TcpListener` so `status`, `stop_vm`, `delete_vm`, `suspend_vm`, `resume_vm`, `provision_temp` are exercised end-to-end (happy path + 4xx/5xx + dead host). `GatewayClient::new`/`new_with_base_url` added for injection. `capsem-tray/src/gateway.rs` jumps from 36% to 94% coverage. Also added `parse_port_file` tests against malformed `gateway.port` contents.
- **capsem-gateway Args + event-ws tests** -- clap default/override tests and a `handle_events_ws`-without-Upgrade test. `main.rs` coverage 69% → 75%.
- **capsem-logger reader fixture-based aggregate tests** -- populates net/model/tool/mcp/fs tables and asserts `session_stats`, `top_domains`, `search_net_events`, `net_event_counts`, `recent_net_events`, `tool_calls_for`, `tool_responses_for`. 24 new tests, reader.rs coverage 75% → 79%.
- **Coverage reporting for capsem-ui, capsem-mcp-aggregator, capsem-mcp-builtin** -- these three crates were invisible to Codecov (never in the `-p` list passed to `cargo llvm-cov`). Added to both macOS and Linux CI runs (capsem-ui macOS-only since Tauri). The `tooling` component in `codecov.yml` now includes the MCP subprocess crates; new `systray` component covers `capsem-tray`; `crates/capsem-app/gen/**` added to ignore list so Tauri-generated code doesn't pollute coverage.
- **PTY ring buffer on host for banner replay** -- `capsem-process` now fronts the terminal broadcast channel with a `TerminalRelay` that retains the last 64 KiB of PTY output. Newly-subscribing WebSocket or IPC clients receive the buffered snapshot atomically (snapshot + subscribe under one mutex) before the live stream, so a fresh browser tab sees the shell's login banner even though the shell printed it before the client connected. Covers both `/terminal` WS (frontend) and `StartTerminalStream` IPC (`capsem shell`).
- **Tray menu split by VM kind** -- persistent running: Connect + Stop + Fork + Delete. Persistent stopped/suspended: Resume + Fork + Delete (or just Fork + Delete when fully stopped). Ephemeral running: Connect + Save + Delete (no Stop, since stopping an ephemeral == destroying it). Save and Fork open the desktop app with `--action save|fork` and dispatch a `capsem:tab-action` event that the Toolbar picks up to open the matching dialog -- the tray can't prompt for a name, so the UI owns it.
- **Tray deep-link uses direct binary path** -- `open -a Capsem --args` only forwards args to a *new* launch on macOS; it drops args when the app is already running. `capsem-tray` now invokes `/Applications/Capsem.app/Contents/MacOS/capsem-ui` (or `~/Applications/...`) directly, so `tauri-plugin-single-instance` sees the second launch and forwards `--connect` / `--action` to the running instance.
- **Session-boot overlay in the terminal** -- three pulsing dots + "Setting up session..." shown while the WS is reconnecting but has never received a byte. Overlay inherits the terminal theme background (no flash), switches to "Reconnecting..." once a real byte has been seen (tracked on first `onmessage`, not on `onopen`, so spurious gateway-initiated closes during VM boot don't trigger the wrong label).
- **`ProvisionRequest.ram_mb` / `cpus` now optional** -- service fills missing fields from merged VM settings (`vm.resources.ram_gb`, `vm.resources.cpu_count`). Lets callers without a settings round-trip (the tray's "New Session") honor the user's configured defaults instead of hardcoding.
- **`capsem-app` reverted to thin webview shell** -- 578-line `main.rs` + 9 helper files (`assets.rs`, `boot.rs`, `cli.rs`, `commands/`, `gui.rs`, `logging.rs`, `session_mgmt.rs`, `state.rs`, `vsock_wiring.rs`) collapsed to a 185-line `main.rs` with 3 IPC commands: `log_frontend`, `open_url`, `check_for_app_update`. Drops `capsem-core`, `capsem-logger`, `anyhow`, `reqwest`, `rmp-serde`, and the macOS `objc2-*` deps from the app. All VM/MCP/MITM logic stays in the service daemon; the app only hosts the webview and deep-link handling.
- **Terminal iframe owns its WebSocket lifecycle** -- replaces the parent/iframe `ready`/`vm-id`/`ws-ticket` postMessage handshake with URL-param init (`/vm/terminal/index.html?vm=…&theme=…&mode=…&fontSize=…&fontFamily=…`). The iframe fetches its own gateway token, manages WebSocket lifecycle + exponential-backoff reconnect with fresh tokens. Parent→iframe postMessage now covers only runtime signals (`theme-change`, `focus`, `clipboard-paste`). Removes `MsgReady`, `MsgVmId`, `MsgWsTicket`, `MsgWsConnected` from the contract.
- **Frontend logging to Rust tracing** -- new `web/app/src/lib/tauri-log.ts` patches `console.*` + `window.onerror` + `onunhandledrejection` to forward via `invoke('log_frontend')` from `@tauri-apps/api/core`. Webview logs now land in `~/.capsem/logs/<timestamp>.jsonl` alongside backend events, target `frontend`. No-op outside the Tauri webview (detects via `__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, not the opt-in `window.isTauri` global).
- **Frontend build timestamp in toolbar** -- `__BUILD_TS__` set at Vite build time, displayed right-side of toolbar. Makes stale-bundle issues obvious at a glance.
- **`just build-ui [release]` recipe** -- frontend build + `cargo build -p capsem-ui` in lockstep. Required because `tauri::generate_context!()` embeds the frontend bundle at cargo compile time; rebuilding only the frontend has no effect on an already-compiled binary. Documented in `CLAUDE.md`, `/dev-just`, and `/frontend-design`.
- **`just run-ui -- [args]`** -- `build-ui` then launch `./target/debug/capsem-ui` with passthrough args (e.g., `just run-ui -- --connect <vm-id>`).

### Removed
- **`POST /setup/assets/download`** -- zero callers anywhere (no frontend, no CLI, no MCP tool wraps it). The handler was a stub that always returned `{"started": false, "reason": "asset pipeline not yet wired -- run \`capsem update\` from the terminal"}`. The real asset download path is the `capsem update` CLI. Removing the route and the `handle_trigger_download` handler; if/when an in-service asset pipeline is added later, add it back under the name that matches its behavior.

### Changed
- **`capsem_service_logs` now routes through the service's `/service-logs` endpoint** instead of opening `$CAPSEM_RUN_DIR/service.log` directly. The direct-file read was an inherited shortcut and left two parallel implementations of the same logic (MCP tool + HTTP handler) that could drift. The MCP tool now has a single code path on par with `capsem_vm_logs`; grep/tail filtering is still applied locally on the returned text. Post-mortem reads when capsem-service has crashed are no longer covered by this tool -- use `tail -f ~/.capsem/run/service.log` from the shell, same as every other tool that can't reach a dead service.

### Fixed
- **Suspend/resume: /root reads now survive a VM restore** -- two bugs compounded. (a) `AppleVzSerialConsole::spawn_reader` started the pipe reader inside `machine.start()` before the capsem-process tokio broadcast subscriber attached, so the first ~100ms of post-resume serial output was dropped by `tokio::broadcast::send` (no receivers, message discarded). The serial log showed no reconnect/rebind activity even though the guest agent was running it, which masked the next bug for months. Now `AppleVzHypervisor::boot` attaches a file-writer subscriber *before* `machine.start()` spawns the reader; log path flows through a new `serial_log_path` field on `VmConfig` / `BootOptions`. The duplicate subscriber in `capsem-process/src/main.rs` is removed. (b) After resume the guest agent has to rebind `/root` onto a fresh virtiofs mount because the old connection is gone, but the chroot's `/mnt/shared` path wasn't created in the rootfs, and `mount --bind` was firing before the new virtiofs had completed its FUSE init handshake with the new host virtiofsd -- so the bind captured a stale-empty subtree and `/root` stayed ENOENT even though the mount reported success. Agent now does `mkdir -p /mnt/shared`, mounts the virtiofs, polls `/mnt/shared/workspace` until `exists()` succeeds (20ms x 50 attempts), then binds to `/root`. Plus the supporting plumbing: persists `VZGenericMachineIdentifier` across save/restore (else `restoreMachineStateFromURL` fails with `VZErrorRestore(12)`), dispatches VZ `pause`/`save_state`/`stop` via `CFRunLoopPerformBlock` (NOT `dispatch_async(main_queue)` -- that deadlocks on VZ's own completions), `fsync`s the checkpoint before process exit, clears stale `.ready` + UDS on resume so `wait_for_vm_ready` doesn't match the prior boot, subscribes every IPC connection to the state broadcast (was only `TerminalOutput`), tolerates `fsfreeze` ENOTSUP on the VirtioFS root, and the agent reconnects via a 3s heartbeat + `POLLHUP` on the vsock fd after the host process disappears. The MCP `test_suspend_and_resume_persistent` xfail is removed; the lifecycle test's `marker in str(read_resp)` substring check is tightened to require `"content" in read_resp` since the ENOENT error message echoes the path (the old assertion was a false-positive on the failing path).
- **`capsem-mcp` now respects HTTP status codes when talking to capsem-service** -- `UdsClient::request` used to discard the response status and try to deserialize every body as success, so a non-2xx response with a JSON body (e.g. the `{"error": "..."}` payload the service returns on 502/503/400) was handed back to the tool layer as `Ok(value)` with an embedded error field. `capsem_mcp_call` printed the raw 502 body as a successful tool result; other tools only avoided this because they happen to run `format_service_response` which catches the embedded `error` key. The client now reads `status()` first and returns `Err("502 Bad Gateway: ...")` on non-success, preferring the `error` field from the JSON body when present.
- **`capsem_core::setup_state::load_state` now warns on corrupt files** -- previously a malformed or truncated `~/.capsem/setup-state.json` was silently swallowed and the function returned `SetupState::default()`, so `capsem setup` would quietly report "no steps done" and re-run the whole wizard with no indication anything was wrong. Now logs a `warn!` with the path and parse error before falling back; behavior on a missing file (the first-run case) is unchanged.
- **`DbReader::query_raw` now validates SQL up front** -- previously it relied on `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY` at the connection level, which made in-memory readers accept writes and produced cryptic "attempt to write a readonly database" errors on the file-backed path. Now calls `validate_select_only` first, returning a clear `<KEYWORD> statements are not allowed` message consistently. Defense-in-depth; no behavior change for valid SELECT queries.
- **Terminal iframe src must end in `index.html`** -- Tauri's custom protocol on macOS does not auto-append `index.html` for trailing-slash paths the way Vite/Astro dev server does. `/vm/terminal/` silently 404'd in the Tauri webview while working in Chrome dev mode.
- **CSP re-enabled without blocking Astro hydration** -- production CSP on the terminal iframe now includes `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src` (Astro emits inline hydration scripts in prod). `connect-src` stays locked to gateway + localhost, which is the meaningful defense against a compromised terminal exfiltrating data.

### Added (existing work, continued)
- **Files API: path sanitization and Magika init** -- allowlist-based `sanitize_file_path` (strips XSS, null bytes, unicode, rejects `..` traversal), `resolve_workspace_path` (canonicalize + starts_with check), and shared `Mutex<magika::Session>` in `ServiceState` for AI-powered file type detection.
- **GET /files/{id} directory listing** -- recursive host-side VirtioFS directory listing with file metadata (size, mtime), Magika file-type detection (label, MIME, is_text) at all depths, hidden file filtering, configurable depth (1-6).
- **GET/POST /files/{id}/content** -- binary-safe file download (raw bytes + Magika MIME type + Content-Disposition) and upload (raw bytes, create_dir_all, mode 0644) via host-side VirtioFS. 10MB limit enforced server-side.
- **Files tab UI** -- host-side file tree replaces vsock `find` command (real sizes, Magika labels, no frame limit), syntax-highlighted file viewer with copy-to-clipboard and download buttons, inline image/SVG preview, binary file handling, drag-and-drop upload with visual overlay and status feedback. Shiki language detection expanded to 30+ languages with content-sniffing fallback.
- **Orthogonal asset versioning** -- binary version (`1.0.{timestamp}`) and asset version (`YYYY.MMDD.patch`) are fully independent. The v2 manifest has separate `assets` and `binaries` sections with `min_binary`/`min_assets` compatibility ranges, deprecation tracking, and release dates. Assets use hash-based filenames (`rootfs-{hash16}.squashfs`) via hardlinks for zero-cost dedup.
- **`capsem status` shows full system health** -- version, service/gateway connectivity and version sync (catches stale processes), asset version with per-file ok/MISSING status.
- **Service `/version` endpoint** -- returns the running service binary version for staleness detection.
- **`/setup/assets` uses resolved paths** -- returns hash-named file paths and asset version instead of hardcoded logical names.

### Changed
- **MCP builtin tools refactored to standalone server** -- HTTP tools (fetch_http, grep_http, http_headers) and snapshot tools (snapshots_changes, snapshots_list, snapshots_revert, etc.) extracted from gateway into `capsem-mcp-builtin`, a stdio MCP server subprocess managed by the aggregator like any external server. Gateway dispatch simplified to route all tool calls uniformly through the aggregator.
- **MCP aggregator IPC switched to MessagePack** -- NDJSON protocol replaced with length-prefixed msgpack frames for better performance and binary safety.
- **MCP server definitions support stdio transport** -- `McpServerDef` gains `command`, `args`, `env` fields. Auto-detected stdio servers from Claude/Gemini configs are now connectable (previously display-only). `unsupported_stdio` field removed.
- **MCP server renamed from "Capsem" to "local"** -- the builtin server is now named "local" in both the settings tree and runtime API for consistency.
- **frontend: MCP section with collapsible server cards** -- each server card expands to show its tools with per-tool allow/ask/block permission selectors. Runtime status badges (running/stopped, tool count) from mcpStore. Refresh button in header.
- **frontend: MCP settings wired to gateway** -- MCP server add/remove/toggle and policy now persist via the settings API. Config reload broadcasts to running VMs immediately.
- **frontend: toolbar redesign** -- hamburger menu on left with view switcher, VM actions moved to dropdown menu, live stats (tokens, tool calls, cost) on the right. Shell OSC title shows in center.
- **frontend: settings page loading states** -- spinner while loading, error banner with retry on failure.
- **frontend: restart button** -- toolbar restart now stops then resumes the VM.
- **frontend: fork auto-opens tab** -- forking a VM automatically opens it in a new tab.

### Added
- **Host-side command recording (3 layers)** -- records all shell commands from the host for tamper-proof auditing:
  - Layer 1 (exec_events): structured API-path commands logged to session.db at dispatch time
  - Layer 2 (pty.log): raw PTY transcript with timestamps and direction tags, 20MB rotation
  - Layer 3 (audit_events): kernel execve syscalls via auditd, streamed over vsock:5006 to session.db
- **`capsem history` CLI** -- `capsem history <session>` with `--layer`, `--search`, `--tail`, `--json` flags
- **History API endpoints** -- `GET /history/{id}`, `/history/{id}/processes`, `/history/{id}/counts`, `/history/{id}/transcript`
- **Cross-session history index** -- `exec_count` and `audit_event_count` columns in main.db sessions table
- **Kernel audit support** -- CONFIG_AUDIT + CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL in guest kernel, auditd started in capsem-init with immutable rules
- **`capsem-mcp-builtin` crate** -- standalone stdio MCP server binary for local tools (HTTP + snapshot). Spawned by the aggregator as "local" server, tools discovered and cached like any external server.
- **MCP aggregator subprocess** -- external MCP server connections now run in an isolated `capsem-mcp-aggregator` subprocess with only network access, no VM/DB/filesystem privileges. Spawned by capsem-process at boot.
- **service MCP API endpoints** -- `GET /mcp/servers`, `GET /mcp/tools`, `GET /mcp/policy`, `POST /mcp/tools/refresh`, `POST /mcp/tools/{name}/approve`, `POST /mcp/tools/{name}/call` unblock the frontend and CLI.
- **CLI `capsem mcp` subcommands** -- `capsem mcp servers`, `capsem mcp tools`, `capsem mcp policy`, `capsem mcp refresh`, `capsem mcp call`.
- **debug MCP tools** -- `capsem_mcp_servers`, `capsem_mcp_tools`, `capsem_mcp_call` in capsem-mcp for AI agent MCP management.
- **MCP IPC protocol** -- `McpListServers`, `McpListTools`, `McpRefreshTools`, `McpCallTool` service-to-process messages with corresponding result types.

### Changed
- **frontend: MCP settings wired to gateway** -- MCP server add/remove/toggle and default tool policy now persist via the settings API instead of local-only state. Servers, tools, and policy load from the gateway on mount.
- **frontend: restart button works** -- toolbar restart button now stops then resumes the VM (was previously identical to stop).
- **frontend: fork auto-opens tab** -- forking a VM from the toolbar now automatically opens the forked VM in a new tab.
- **frontend: settings loading/error states** -- settings page shows a spinner while loading and an error banner with retry on failure.

### Fixed
- **Stale update cache suggests downgrade** -- `read_cached_update_notice` now re-validates with `is_newer` before displaying, preventing bogus "Update available: 1.0.x -> 0.16.x" notices after a version scheme change.
- **Install leaves stale gateway token** -- `just install` now unloads the LaunchAgent before killing processes, preventing macOS from respawning the old service. Cleans stale `gateway.token` and `gateway.port` files.
- **Asset resolution in arch subdirs** -- `ManifestV2::resolve` checks both `base_dir/{hash}` and `base_dir/{arch}/{hash}`, fixing installed service asset lookup.
- **`_pack-initrd` skips docker when binaries are current** -- avoids unnecessary container cross-compile on every `just shell`.
- **v1 asset code removed** -- `asset_manager.rs` reduced from 1947 to ~400 lines. All v1 types, download infra, and legacy cleanup deleted. Download stubs point to `sprints/orthogonal-ci/plan.md`.
- **MITM cert "not yet valid" after Mac sleep** -- leaf certificates now use a fixed `notBefore` of 2026-01-01 instead of `now - 1h`, preventing cert validation failures when the guest clock drifts. Ping messages now carry `epoch_secs` so the guest clock resyncs every 10s heartbeat, covering Mac sleep/wake and long-running VMs.
- **frontend: tab names use VM name** -- provisioning and deep-link flows now show the VM's fun name (e.g. "tmp-agile-blaze") instead of the raw ID.
- **frontend: snapshot stats query real VM** -- Snapshots tab in Stats view now queries the VM's session.db via `/inspect` instead of the local mock database.
- **frontend: VM logs and service logs wired** -- VM Logs view parses NDJSON process logs into structured table with level/source/message columns and Process/Serial toggle. Service Logs view fetches from new `/service-logs` endpoint.
- **frontend: detail panel restored** -- click any tool call, network request, or file event row in Stats to open a slide-out detail panel with Shiki syntax-highlighted JSON, headers, and request/response bodies.

### Changed
- **frontend: removed URL bar** -- toolbar no longer shows the address/search bar; cleaner layout with just VM actions and view switcher.
- **frontend: removed Inspector tab** -- Inspector view removed from the toolbar view switcher; available via hamburger menu if needed.
- **frontend: removed status dot** -- connection indicator dot removed from toolbar.
- **service: added /service-logs endpoint** -- returns last 100KB of service.log as plain text for the frontend Service Logs view.

### Changed
- **build: auto-prune stale cargo artifacts** -- `_clean-stale` now removes orphaned `.o`/`.rlib`/`.rmeta` files and incremental dirs older than 3 days when `target/` exceeds 10 GB. Runs automatically after `test`, `smoke`, and `install` to prevent unbounded growth (previously hit 72 GB from accumulated hash variants).
- **CLI: simplified command structure** -- removed `service` subcommand group; `install`, `status`, `start`, `stop` are now top-level commands. Removed session-level `stop` (use `suspend` or `delete`) and `status` (use `info`). Removed `start` alias from `create`. Renamed all "sandbox" terminology to "session". Session identifier parameter shows as `<SESSION>` in help.
- **CLI: enriched `list` output** -- table now shows NAME, STATUS, RAM, CPUs, and UPTIME columns instead of the old ID/STATUS/PERSIST/PID.
- **CLI: enriched `info` output** -- shows formatted session details with telemetry (tokens, cost, tool calls, requests) instead of raw JSON. Use `--json` for machine-readable output.
- **CLI: service start/stop** -- new `capsem start` and `capsem stop` commands to start/stop the background daemon via launchctl (macOS) or systemctl (Linux).
- **MCP: tool descriptions updated** -- all tool descriptions now use "session" instead of "VM" or "sandbox".

### Fixed
- **tray: icon stays white template** -- tray icon no longer switches to a dark non-template icon when VMs are running. Always uses the template icon so macOS adapts it to menu bar appearance.
- **tray: VM names no longer truncated** -- VM labels in the tray menu now show the full name or ID instead of truncating to 8 characters.
- **tray: unified "New Session" action** -- replaced "New Temporary" and "New Permanent..." menu items with a single "New Session" that creates a session (save it to make it permanent).

### Added
- **VM identity: fun temporary names** -- ephemeral VMs get memorable names like `tmp-brave-falcon` instead of opaque `vm-1712345678`. Persistent VMs keep user-chosen names. Shell prompt now shows the VM name (hostname) instead of static "capsem".
- **VM identity: host timezone injection** -- guest VMs inherit the host's timezone at boot via `TZ` env var and `/etc/localtime`. `date` inside the VM now shows local time instead of UTC. Clock and timezone are also resynced on resume from suspend.
- **service: settings endpoints** -- `GET /settings` returns the merged settings tree (user + corp + defaults) with issues and presets. `POST /settings` batch-updates settings atomically. `GET /settings/presets` lists security presets. `POST /settings/presets/{id}` applies a preset. `POST /settings/lint` validates config. All endpoints are thin wrappers around existing `capsem-core` functions.
- **service: telemetry-enriched `/list`** -- running VMs in `GET /list` now include live telemetry (tokens, cost, tool calls, requests, file events) read from session.db. Shared `enrich_telemetry()` function used by both `/list` and `/info/{id}`.
- **gateway: telemetry pass-through in `/status`** -- `VmSummary` now includes 11 optional telemetry fields forwarded from the service. Frontend gets per-VM stats in a single poll without per-VM API calls.
- **frontend: dashboard global stats** -- NewTabPage shows 4 summary cards (sessions, total tokens, total cost, requests) from `GET /stats` cross-session aggregation.
- **frontend: VM table telemetry columns** -- Uptime, Tokens, Cost columns in the sandbox table. Shows "--" for stopped VMs, live values for running.
- **frontend: `getStats()` API** -- new API function with graceful offline handling (returns empty stats when disconnected).
- **frontend: shared formatters** -- `format.ts` with `formatUptime`, `formatTokens`, `formatCost`, `formatDuration`, `formatBytes`, `formatTime`, `truncate`, `fmtAge`. StatsView refactored to use shared module.
- **standalone installer: macOS .pkg build** -- `build_system/packaging/macos/build-pkg.sh` assembles a .pkg from the Tauri .app, all 6 companion binaries, VM assets, and a postinstall script that copies to `~/.capsem/bin/`, codesigns, registers LaunchAgent, and runs setup. CI pipeline updated to build .pkg alongside .dmg.
- **`just install` builds and installs the platform package** -- builds release binaries, frontend, and Tauri app, then assembles and installs the native package: .pkg with macOS Installer GUI on macOS, .deb via `dpkg -i` on Linux. The postinstall script handles codesign, PATH, service registration, and setup. Replaces the old `simulate-install.sh` bypass.
- **`just test-install` exercises the real .deb path** -- Docker e2e tests now build a real .deb (Tauri + `repack-deb.sh`), install with `dpkg -i` (exercising `deb-postinst.sh` with systemd registration and setup), then run the pytest suite against the installed layout. Named volumes cache cargo builds across runs. Tests split into packaging (run in Docker) and `live_system` (need VM assets, run on real systems).
- **standalone installer: Linux .deb repack** -- `build_system/packaging/linux/repack-deb.sh` injects companion binaries and a postinst script into the Tauri .deb. Postinst symlinks system binaries to `~/.capsem/bin/`, registers systemd user unit, and runs setup.
- **CLI: auto-setup on first use** -- running any sandbox command without prior `capsem setup` triggers non-interactive setup automatically (service registration, credential detection, asset download). Skipped when `--uds-path` is explicit.
- **`just install`: graceful stop + health check** -- stops existing service before overwriting binaries, verifies service health after registration, auto-runs setup on first install.

### Fixed
- **CLI: delete nonexistent sandbox now returns error** -- HTTP status code was not checked before deserializing response body, causing 404 errors to be silently swallowed when `T = serde_json::Value` in the untagged `ApiResponse` enum.
- **uninstall: kill and remove all 6 binaries** -- capsem-gateway and capsem-tray were missing from the CAPSEM_BINARIES list and pkill commands.
- **install: .pkg and .deb packaging scripts fail on missing binaries** -- `build-pkg.sh` and `repack-deb.sh` printed a WARNING and continued when a companion binary was missing, potentially producing broken packages in CI. Now exit with error, matching `simulate-install.sh` behavior.
- **install: setup-state.json atomic write** -- `save_state()` used `fs::write()` directly; a crash mid-write could corrupt the setup state. Now uses temp file + `fs::rename` for atomic updates.
- **install: macOS .pkg postinstall user detection** -- postinstall script assumed `$USER` was always set correctly by macOS Installer.app. When installed via `sudo installer -pkg` (CLI), `$USER` is root. Now checks `$SUDO_USER` first, falls back to console owner via `stat /dev/console`.
- **install: Linux .deb postinst XDG_RUNTIME_DIR** -- `deb-postinst.sh` ran `su $TARGET_USER -c "capsem service install"` without propagating `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, causing `systemctl --user` to fail. Now passes `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$UID` explicitly.

### Changed
- **image elimination: everything is a sandbox** -- removed the "image" concept entirely. `fork` now creates a stopped persistent sandbox instead of an image. `create --from <sandbox>` replaces `create --image`. Image registry, image CLI commands, and image MCP tools are all removed. `--image` remains as a hidden alias for `--from`. `SandboxInfo` API now includes `forked_from` and `description` fields. Session DB schema bumped to v6 (renames `source_image` to `forked_from`). Net reduction: ~500 lines and one abstraction layer.
- **CI: test 6 additional Rust crates** -- capsem-service, capsem (CLI), capsem-mcp, capsem-tray, capsem-process now run in CI (422 tests were previously local-only). capsem-app gets a compile check.
- **CI: run non-VM Python integration tests** -- capsem-bootstrap, capsem-codesign, capsem-rootfs-artifacts suites now execute in CI. All 25 integration suites are collect-only verified.
- **CI: Rust coverage floor** -- `--fail-under-lines 70` enforced on both macOS and Linux CI jobs. Codecov unit upload now fails CI on error.
- **capsem-process: module decomposition** -- split 1,522-line main.rs monolith into 6 modules (helpers, job_store, vsock, ipc, terminal + main). Tests grew from 24 to 62.
- **dev-testing skill: test matrix** -- added Rust crate CI matrix, Python integration suite tier map, and coverage targets documentation.
- **integration tests: suite expansion** -- capsem-recovery (4->9 tests: stale sentinels, partial sessions, post-recovery health), capsem-stress (3->7: rapid exec, file I/O, name reuse, mass delete), capsem-config-runtime (5->10: env injection, python3, arch match, workspace write, rootfs readonly), capsem-session-lifecycle (6->10: WAL cleanup, ordered events, domain fields, live DB reads). Fixed two `>= 0` assertions that always passed.

### Added
- **service: `GET /stats` endpoint** -- returns full main.db aggregation in one call: global stats (tokens, cost, tool calls, network counts), recent sessions with all telemetry columns, top providers, top tools, and top MCP tools. Replaces the need for raw SQL on `_main`.
- **service: `/inspect/_main` support** -- the `/inspect/{id}` endpoint now recognizes `_main` as a sentinel, routing raw SQL queries to the global session index (main.db) instead of a per-VM session.db. Unblocks `queryDbMain()` in the frontend.
- **service: `SandboxInfo` telemetry fields** -- `/info/{id}` now returns live session telemetry for running VMs: input/output tokens, estimated cost, tool calls, MCP calls, network request counts, file events, model call count, and uptime. `/list` includes uptime for running VMs. All new fields are optional and omitted when absent for backwards compatibility.
- **gateway: token endpoint for browser auth** -- `GET /token` returns the auth token, restricted to loopback IP (127.0.0.1/::1) via hardcoded peer IP check. Allows browser-based frontends to authenticate without filesystem access.
- **gateway: WebSocket query-param auth** -- `/terminal/{id}` paths accept `?token=` query parameter as auth fallback for browser WebSocket connections (which cannot set custom headers). Only the `token` param is recognized; all others are silently dropped. Non-terminal paths ignore query params entirely.
- **frontend: settings export/import** -- export all settings to JSON file, import from previously exported file. Import stages changes for review before saving. Validates version, skips corp-locked and unchanged settings.
- **frontend: MCP server management UI** -- add/remove/enable/disable external MCP servers from the settings page. Form with name, URL, bearer token, and custom headers. Replaces the "edit config.toml" placeholder.
- **smoke: per-step timing and log file** -- smoke recipe now logs to `target/smoke.log` with elapsed time per step and total. `capsem doctor --fast` skips the 64s throughput download test.
- **smoke: parallel test groups** -- Python integration tests run MCP, service/CLI, and gateway groups concurrently (122s -> 58s). Pre-signs binaries to avoid codesign races.
- **bench: host-side lifecycle and fork benchmarks** -- `just bench` now runs both in-VM benchmarks and host-side lifecycle/fork benchmarks from `test_lifecycle_benchmark.py`.

### Fixed
- **tray: invisible menu bar icon** -- tray main loop used `thread::sleep(16ms)` which does not pump the macOS Cocoa run loop. `NSStatusItem` requires an active run loop to render. Replaced with `CFRunLoopRunInMode` which processes AppKit events at the same 60 Hz cadence.
- **service: companion logs to files** -- gateway and tray child processes had stdout/stderr routed to `/dev/null`, making debugging impossible. Now logs to `~/Library/Logs/capsem/gateway.log` and `tray.log`, falling back to null if the file can't be opened.
- **install: remove stale pgrep wait loop** -- service install no longer polls for capsem-tray death after `bootout` + `pkill -9`, removing up to 3s of unnecessary latency.
- **agent: venv activation race** -- capsem-pty-agent now waits up to 3s for capsem-init's background venv creation before checking `/root/.venv/bin/activate`. Previously the agent checked once and missed it, leaving `VIRTUAL_ENV` unset for the shell and all exec commands.
- **agent: write_nofollow missing parent dirs** -- runtime `FileWrite` via `write_nofollow()` now creates parent directories before opening the file. Previously, writing to `/root/project/main.py` failed with "No such file or directory" if `/root/project/` didn't exist.
- **service: handle_delete now waits for process death** -- `handle_delete` gives the VM process 500ms to flush its session DB, then SIGKILLs if still alive. Previously it was fire-and-forget: the HTTP 200 returned before the process died, leaving orphans when the service was restarted.
- **service: handle_stop now waits for process death** -- same fix as delete. Prevents resume from racing the old process on the same socket (old process's shutdown timer would kill the new one).
- **service: handle_run rollup race** -- session DB rollup (file events, net events, MCP calls) now completes before the HTTP response returns. Previously it was `tokio::spawn`'d fire-and-forget, so callers reading `main.db` immediately after `capsem run` saw empty counters.
- **service: wait_for_process_exit verifies SIGKILL** -- after sending SIGKILL, now polls for up to 2s to confirm the process actually died. Logs a warning/error if it survives.
- **service: socket path fallback for long run_dir paths** -- `instance_socket_path()` falls back to `/tmp/capsem/{hash}.sock` when the preferred `{run_dir}/instances/{id}.sock` path exceeds 90 bytes. Fixes "path must be shorter than SUN_LEN" crashes when tests use `/var/folders/...` temp dirs.
- **install: dev symlink conflict** -- `simulate-install.sh` now removes the `~/.capsem/assets` dev symlink before copying real assets. Previously `cp` failed with "identical file" when the symlink pointed at the source.
- **install: PATH added to correct shell profile** -- install now writes to `~/.bash_profile` (if it exists) instead of `~/.bashrc` on bash, since macOS Terminal opens login shells that don't source `~/.bashrc`.
- **justfile: _ensure-service kills orphaned VM processes** -- kills `capsem-process` instances before killing the service, with a SIGKILL follow-up. Previously, service restart orphaned running VMs.
- **test: codesign race in parallel test groups** -- `sign_binary()` now uses file locking to prevent concurrent test processes from corrupting binaries during `codesign --force`.
- **test: fork timing gate relaxed** -- `test_winter_is_coming` fork gate raised from 0.5s to 2.0s. The proper gate (500ms over 3 runs) is in the dedicated fork benchmark.

### Fixed
- **frontend: syntax highlighting race condition** -- file editor controls (settings.json, state.json, etc.) now reliably get Shiki syntax coloring. Previously the first FileEditorControl to mount could miss highlighting due to async Shiki init not re-triggering the render effect.
- **frontend: design system color violations** -- MCP section badges and status indicators now use semantic tokens (blue=positive, purple=negative) instead of raw green/red Tailwind colors.
- **perf: cold boot 6x faster (6.2s -> 1.0s)** -- first VM boot was wasting 5 seconds on a silent IPC Ping timeout. When `vm_ready` was false, capsem-process silently dropped the Ping and the service waited the full 5s before retrying. Fixed: process now closes the connection immediately on not-ready Ping, and readiness is signaled via a `.ready` sentinel file (stat() check, 5ms poll) instead of IPC round trips. Also deduplicated three hand-rolled exponential backoff implementations (vsock_connect_retry, reconnect loop, CLI connect_with_timeout) into a shared `capsem_proto::poll` module with `RetryOpts` + `retry_with_backoff`, reused by the async `capsem_core::poll::poll_until` via type alias.
- **perf: async VM delete (5s -> 20ms)** -- `shutdown_vm_process` now sends the shutdown signal and returns immediately. Process teardown (wait + force-kill + socket cleanup) runs in a background task. Telemetry rollup in `handle_run` waits for process exit in background before reading session.db, ensuring DbWriter has flushed. Also: consolidated redundant mutex acquisitions in `handle_fork` (4 locks -> 1-2) and `handle_persist` (2 locks -> 1), parallelized IPC fan-out in `handle_reload_config` and `handle_purge` with `join_all`, moved `remove_dir_all` to `spawn_blocking`, added periodic cleanup timer, logged registry save failures.
- **perf: capsem-process self-exit on shutdown** -- after forwarding `HostToGuest::Shutdown` to the guest agent, capsem-process now waits `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS + 500ms` then calls `vm.stop()` and `exit(0)`. Previously, `CFRunLoopRun` kept the process alive indefinitely after guest shutdown, requiring SIGKILL from the service.
- **fork: full VM state preservation** -- fork now captures both rootfs overlay and workspace files. Previously, `create_session_from_image()` cloned data to `session_dir/system/` and `session_dir/workspace/` (real directories), but the VM only sees `session_dir/guest/` via VirtioFS, so cloned data was invisible to the guest. Fixed to clone into `guest/` subdirectories with compat symlinks, matching the VirtioFS share layout.
- **disk usage: report actual blocks, not logical size** -- `disk_usage_bytes()` now uses `blocks * 512` instead of `meta.len()`, so sparse files (e.g. a 2GB rootfs.img overlay with 9MB of actual changes) report their true disk footprint. Fixes inflated image sizes in `capsem_image_inspect`.
- **benchmark: fork performance and size regression gates** -- `test_fork_benchmark` in `test_lifecycle_benchmark.py` profiles fork speed (< 500ms gate), image size (< 12MB gate), boot-from-image speed, and data survival (packages + workspace). Runs 3 cycles with per-run and summary output + JSON.
- **CLI: connect timeout with exponential backoff** -- CLI no longer hangs when the service socket is unreachable. `connect_with_timeout()` retries with exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, ..., up to 10 attempts). Fails immediately on ENOENT or connection refused. Explicit `--uds-path` skips auto-launch entirely for instant failure.
- **test: DRY shared constants and helpers across integration tests** -- extracted `DEFAULT_RAM_MB`, `DEFAULT_CPUS`, `EXEC_READY_TIMEOUT`, `EXEC_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `HTTP_TIMEOUT`, and `GUEST_WORKSPACE` into `tests/helpers/constants.py`. Moved duplicated `parse_content`, `content_text`, `wait_exec_ready`, and `wait_file_ready` helpers into `tests/helpers/mcp.py`. Updated 49 test files to use shared constants and helpers instead of hardcoded values.
- **test: fix file I/O paths rejected by workspace sandbox** -- tests were writing to `/tmp/` which the agent now correctly rejects as outside the workspace root (`/root/`). Fixed all service, gateway, isolation, session, and E2E test paths to use `/root/`.

### Added
- **VM lifecycle: guest-initiated shutdown** -- `shutdown`, `halt`, `poweroff`, and `reboot` commands work inside the VM via `capsem-sysutil`, a multi-call binary deployed to `/run/capsem-sysutil` with symlinks in `/sbin/`. Opens a dedicated vsock:5004 lifecycle channel (independent of the PTY agent) to send `ShutdownRequest` to the host. Reboot prints an error (not supported in sandbox). Includes countdown timer matching `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS`.
- **VM lifecycle: suspend and warm resume** -- persistent VMs can be suspended via `capsem suspend <name>` (CLI), `capsem_suspend` (MCP), or `suspend` inside the guest. Uses Apple VZ `saveMachineStateTo` (macOS 14+) with a quiescence protocol: agent freezes filesystem (`fsfreeze -f /`), host pauses VM, saves checkpoint, stops. Resume detects checkpoint file and uses `restoreMachineStateFrom` for warm restore. Agent reconnects with exponential backoff, re-sends Ready, and thaws filesystem.
- **VM identity** -- service injects `CAPSEM_VM_ID` (UUID) and `CAPSEM_VM_NAME` (user-chosen name or UUID for ephemeral) as environment variables. Agent calls `sethostname(CAPSEM_VM_NAME)` after boot so the shell prompt reflects the VM name.
- **VmHandle trait: pause/resume/save/restore** -- hypervisor abstraction extended with `pause()`, `resume()`, `save_state(path)`, `restore_state(path)`, and `supports_checkpoint()`. Apple VZ implementation dispatches to main thread. KVM defaults return errors.
- **capsem-doctor: lifecycle diagnostics** -- new `test_lifecycle.py` category verifying sysutil symlinks (`/sbin/shutdown`, `/sbin/halt`, `/sbin/poweroff`, `/sbin/reboot`, `/usr/local/bin/suspend`), `CAPSEM_VM_ID`/`CAPSEM_VM_NAME` env vars, and hostname matching VM name.
- **capsem-gateway: TCP-to-UDS reverse proxy** -- standalone binary that bridges TCP (default port 19222) to capsem-service UDS. Bearer token auth (64-char random, regenerated on restart, written to `~/.capsem/run/gateway.token` with 0600 permissions). All service endpoints proxied through with method/path/query/body preserved. `GET /` health check (no auth). `GET /status` aggregated VM health with 2s cache TTL for efficient tray polling. CORS permissive for browser access. Graceful shutdown cleans up token/port/pid files. No capsem-core dependency, no VM access -- pure low-privilege proxy.
- **capsem-service: auto-spawn gateway and tray** -- service now spawns capsem-gateway (TCP proxy) and capsem-tray (macOS menu bar) as child processes on startup. Both are killed on graceful shutdown. Tray spawn is macOS-only, gateway spawn is cross-platform. Sibling binary discovery falls back to target/debug/ for development.

### Changed
- **exec: separated from interactive PTY** -- exec commands now spawn a direct child process with piped stdout instead of injecting into the shared PTY and scanning for a magic ESC sentinel. Output flows on a dedicated vsock port 5005 (`VSOCK_PORT_EXEC`) with an `ExecStarted { id }` handshake, while `ExecDone` continues on the control channel. Eliminates sentinel spoofing risk, removes `strip_ansi()` post-processing, and keeps control_loop responsive to heartbeats during long-running commands. The interactive terminal (vsock:5001) is no longer contaminated by exec output.
- **removed capsem-app direct CLI mode** -- deleted `run_cli()` and `cli.rs` from capsem-app. All VM operations now go through capsem-service (single path). The Tauri GUI uses the service API like every other client.

### Security
- **image name path traversal** -- image names (fork, inspect, delete) are now validated with the same rules as VM names (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only). Previously, a name like `../../etc` could escape the images directory during fork or trigger `remove_dir_all` outside the sandbox on delete. Defense-in-depth assertion added to `ImageRegistry::image_dir()`.
- **persistent registry atomic writes** -- `PersistentRegistry::save()` now uses write-to-tmp + fsync + rename instead of direct `std::fs::write`. Prevents a crash mid-write from producing a zero-byte or partial JSON file, which would lose all persistent VM state on next startup.
- **symlink sandbox escape hardening** -- guest agent FileWrite/FileRead/FileDelete handlers now validate paths with `validate_file_path_safe()` (canonicalize + workspace containment check) and use `O_NOFOLLOW` on actual file operations to eliminate TOCTOU window. Previously, FileWrite had no validation at all, and FileRead/FileDelete only checked for `..` and NUL bytes. A compromised guest could create a symlink pointing outside `/root/` and read/write/delete arbitrary files through it. Snapshot system now preserves symlinks instead of silently dropping them, includes them in workspace hashes and file counts, and surfaces `is_symlink` in MCP snapshot listings.
- **capsem-gateway: 10 MB request body size limit** -- proxy now enforces a 10 MB maximum on incoming request bodies via `http_body_util::Limited`, returning 413 Payload Too Large for oversized payloads. Prevents OOM from malicious clients.
- **capsem-gateway: CORS restricted to localhost origins** -- replaced `CorsLayer::permissive()` (allow all origins) with a predicate that only allows `http(s)://localhost`, `http(s)://127.0.0.1`, and `tauri://` origins. Prevents cross-origin requests from external websites.
- **capsem-gateway: auth failure rate limiting** -- after 20 failed auth attempts within 60 seconds, the gateway returns 429 Too Many Requests instead of 401. Prevents brute-force token guessing.
- **capsem-process: UDS sockets hardened to 0600** -- IPC and terminal WebSocket sockets now have chmod 0600 after bind. Previously inherited umask (0755), allowing any local user to connect to a VM's terminal or send exec commands with no auth.
- **capsem-process: environment cleared on spawn** -- service now uses `env_clear()` before spawning capsem-process, passing only `HOME`, `PATH`, `USER`, `TMPDIR`, `RUST_LOG`. Prevents API keys, tokens, and secrets from the user's shell leaking into per-VM processes.
- **capsem-process: serial.log permissions 0600** -- serial log files now created with explicit 0600 mode. Previously world-readable via umask default, potentially exposing terminal output containing secrets.
- **capsem-process: guest cannot force process exit** -- control channel read error on vsock:5000 now breaks the read loop instead of calling `process::exit(1)`. A compromised guest can no longer DoS its host process by closing the vsock fd.
- **capsem-tray: macOS menu bar tray** -- standalone binary that polls the gateway `/status` endpoint. VMs split into Permanent and Temporary sections. Permanent VMs get Connect/Resume, Fork, Stop, Delete; temporary VMs get Connect/Resume, Delete. Connect/Resume is a single context-sensitive button (shows Resume when suspended). "New Permanent..." opens UI with name dialog. Color-coded icons: purple (active), black template (idle, auto light/dark), red (error). Uses `tray-icon` + `muda` for native NSStatusItem. No capsem-core dependency, no Tauri.

### Fixed
- **capsem doctor: streaming output and VM cleanup** -- doctor now types the command into the shell (TerminalInput) instead of using Exec, so test output streams in real-time instead of buffering until completion. VM is always deleted on exit, including Ctrl-C. Full output written to `~/.capsem/run/doctor-latest.log`.
- **capsem-sysutil: help output to stdout** -- `print_help()` wrote to stderr (`eprintln!`), so `shutdown --help` appeared empty to callers checking stdout. Now uses `println!`.
- **snapshot revert: symlink support** -- revert used `.exists()` (follows symlinks) and `fs::copy` (dereferences), so reverting a symlink failed with "file does not exist". Now uses `symlink_metadata()` to detect symlinks and restores them with `read_link` + `symlink()`. Auto-select also uses `symlink_metadata` so snapshots containing only symlinks are found.
- **snapshot revert: VirtioFS stale cache** -- overwriting a file via `fs::copy` could leave VirtioFS with a stale cached size, causing truncated reads in the guest. Now removes the file first and fsyncs after write to force cache invalidation.
- **venv activation in exec** -- agent now adds `VIRTUAL_ENV` and prepends venv bin to `PATH` in boot_env after capsem-init creates the venv. Both PTY shell and exec commands see the venv. Removed duplicate activation from capsem-bashrc.
- **capsem-process: service-initiated suspend was silently dropped** -- the IPC handler in `handle_ipc_connection` matched `ServiceToProcess::Suspend` but logged "not yet implemented" instead of forwarding to the ctrl channel where the actual suspend logic lives. `capsem suspend <id>` and the MCP `capsem_suspend` tool were non-functional. Now forwards to the ctrl channel like `Shutdown` does.
- **capsem-agent: reconnect timer never reset** -- `start_reconnect` was set once at first disconnect and never updated after successful reconnect. A second suspend/resume cycle >30s into the VM's lifetime caused the agent to immediately timeout and exit. Now resets timer and backoff delay after each successful reconnect.
- **capsem-sysutil: operator precedence bug in --help guard** -- `a == "--help" || a == "-h" && cmd != "shutdown"` parsed as `"--help" || ("-h" && ...)` due to `&&` binding tighter. Added explicit parentheses.
- **capsem-sysutil: fd leak on write failure** -- `send_lifecycle_msg` did not close the vsock fd if `write_all_fd` or `encode_guest_msg` failed. Now closes fd on all paths.
- **capsem-service: suspend silently reported success on failure** -- `handle_suspend` discarded IPC send errors with `let _` and returned `{"success": true}` even when the VM never confirmed suspended state. Now propagates all IPC errors and returns 500 if the VM does not confirm suspension within 15 seconds.
- **capsem-service: resume did not pass checkpoint path** -- `resume_sandbox` re-spawned `capsem-process` without `--checkpoint-path`, causing suspended VMs to cold-boot instead of warm-restoring. Now passes `--checkpoint-path` when the registry entry has `suspended: true` and the checkpoint file exists.
- **capsem-service: resume did not clear suspended flag** -- after successful resume, `entry.suspended` stayed `true` and `entry.checkpoint_path` retained the stale value. Now clears both and saves the registry.
- **capsem-service: /list and /info did not distinguish Suspended from Stopped** -- persistent VMs with `suspended: true` were reported as "Stopped". Now returns "Suspended" status, and the gateway's `/status` endpoint includes `suspended_count` in `ResourceSummary`.
- **capsem-gateway: terminal WebSocket gave no error on VM unavailable** -- when the per-VM UDS connect failed after WebSocket upgrade, the connection silently dropped. Now sends a Close frame with code 1011 and reason "VM not available".
- **capsem-gateway: proxy timeout too short for suspend** -- 30-second proxy timeout could expire during suspend operations (up to 26s). Increased to 120 seconds. Added 5-minute safety timeout on the background HTTP connection driver.
- **capsem-gateway: terminal UDS path fallback incorrect** -- `terminal_uds_path` used `parent().unwrap_or("/tmp")` which never triggered for bare filenames (parent returns `Some("")`). Now filters empty parents before falling back.
- **capsem-process: VirtioFS share narrowed to guest/ subtree** -- VirtioFS previously shared the full `session_dir`, exposing `session.db`, `serial.log`, and `auto_snapshots/` to the guest. Now only `session_dir/guest/` (containing `system/` and `workspace/`) is shared. Host-only files are outside the share boundary. Compat symlinks preserve existing code paths.
- **capsem-gateway: proxy URI parse could panic** -- `forward()` used `.unwrap()` on `upstream_uri.parse()`, which could panic on malformed URIs. Replaced with error propagation that returns 502 Bad Gateway.
- **capsem-gateway: terminal WebSocket rejected underscores in VM IDs** -- `handle_terminal_ws` validation allowed only `[a-zA-Z0-9-]`, rejecting persistent VMs with underscores (e.g. `my_dev`). Aligned with service's `validate_vm_name()`: `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`, must start alphanumeric, length 1-64.
- **capsem-gateway: terminal.rs had zero test coverage** -- added 31 unit + integration tests covering ID validation, UDS path construction, WebSocket relay (text, binary, ping/pong, close with reason, process disconnect, client disconnect, missing UDS, invalid ID rejection). Coverage went from 0% to 89%.
- **capsem-gateway: not tracked in CI coverage** -- added `-p capsem-gateway` to CI coverage pipeline and `gateway` component to codecov.yml (80% target).
- **capsem-process: process.log written in text format instead of JSONL** -- tracing subscriber used default text formatter with ANSI colors, making process.log unparseable by integration tests and tooling. Switched to JSON format matching capsem-service. Also changed RUST_LOG from `debug` to `capsem=info` for subprocess to avoid noisy debug entries.
- **capsem run: session not registered in main.db** -- `handle_run` in capsem-service provisioned and destroyed VMs without creating a session record or rolling up telemetry counters. Sessions from `capsem run` were invisible to `capsem sessions` and integration tests.
- **capsem run: missing `--env` support** -- `capsem run` had no way to pass environment variables to the guest, unlike `capsem create -e`. Added `--env`/`-e` to CLI, `env` field to `RunRequest`, and `env` param to `capsem_run` MCP tool. Integration test now passes API key via `--env` instead of relying on process env inheritance.
- **capsem-process: missing boot timeline in process.log** -- state transition events were only emitted in the capsem-app CLI path, not in capsem-process. Boot timeline is now logged after `boot_vm` returns.
- **Test scripts missing `run` subcommand** -- `injection_test.py`, `integration_test.py`, and `doctor_session_test.py` called `capsem <command>` instead of `capsem run <command>`, causing exit 2 on all scenarios. Also improved failure output to show full stdout/stderr instead of just lines matching "FAILED".
- **capsem-init: guest binaries deployed 755 instead of 555** -- `capsem-doctor`, `capsem-bench`, and `snapshots` were deployed with write bits via initrd overlay, violating the read-only binary invariant.
- **Dead code wired into production paths** -- consolidated duplicate path logic between `paths.rs` and `service_install.rs`. `is_service_installed()` now guards `try_ensure_service()` to prevent unmanaged duplicate service spawns. `start_background_download()` wired into setup wizard. `install_bin_dir()` wired into uninstall for layout-aware binary removal. `assets_dir_from_home()` used by `discover_paths()`. Removed `ServiceSpawnArgs` (was identical to `CapsemPaths`). Zero `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations remain.
- **initrd repack: permission denied on read-only guest binaries** -- `_pack-initrd` now `rm -f` before overwriting 555-permission files (`capsem-doctor`, `capsem-bench`, `snapshots`), matching the pattern already used for agent binaries.
- **Service race condition on exec/write/read after provision** -- `handle_exec`, `handle_write_file`, and `handle_read_file` now wait for the VM socket to be ready before sending IPC commands. Previously, calling these endpoints immediately after `/provision` or `/resume` would fail with "failed to connect to sandbox" because the capsem-process had not yet created its socket. Extracted `wait_for_vm_ready` helper (socket existence + ping) shared by all IPC handlers. This fixes `capsem doctor` and any client that calls exec without polling.
- **pnpm audit: defu prototype pollution and vite file read vulnerabilities** -- added `defu>=6.1.5` and `vite>=6.4.2` overrides to frontend `pnpm.overrides`.
- **capsem-process: reject invalid fd -1 in clone_fd** -- defensive check prevents undefined behavior when an invalid file descriptor is passed.
- **capsem doctor: streaming output** -- doctor now streams test results in real-time via terminal IPC instead of buffering all output until completion. Also adds `--durations=10` to surface the 10 slowest tests.
- **capsem doctor: removed invalid --json flag** -- `capsem-doctor` is a pytest wrapper that doesn't support `--json`. The flag caused pytest to exit with "unrecognized arguments".
- **MCP snapshots_changes: JSON pagination breaks parsing** -- `format=json` output was wrapped in pagination headers (`Content length: ...`), making `json.loads()` fail. JSON format now returns the raw array without pagination headers.
- **Guest binary permissions: snapshots and capsem-bench** -- changed from 755 to 555 in rootfs Dockerfile to match the read-only binary invariant.
- **Rust warnings-as-errors for all crates** -- `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --workspace` now runs in both `just smoke` and `just test`, blocking on any warning in any crate. Previously only capsem-service and capsem-process were checked, and only in `just test`.

- **Settings system** -- dynamic settings UI rendered from the backend tree structure (not mocked). Recursive `SettingsSection` renderer handles all setting types: bool toggles (immediate save), text/number/select inputs (staged batch save), password fields with reveal + prefix validation + "required" badge, file editors with Shiki syntax highlighting (theme-aware, shared singleton), domain chip lists (add/remove). Toggle-gated provider cards with slide transitions, chevron animation, and collapsed warning summaries. Settings store (`settings.svelte.ts`) with `load/stage/save/discard/updateImmediate`. Settings model (`settings-model.ts`) with tree indexing, widget resolution, preset matching, pending changes tracking. MCP section with policy, built-in tools, and external servers. Security preset selector. Dirty bar with unsaved change count + Save/Discard. WCAG AA contrast tests for all warning/error/status colors (11 checks, amber-700/red-700 light, amber-400/red-300 dark). 206 tests passing.

- **Gateway wiring (Sprint 05)** -- frontend now connects to capsem-gateway for real data instead of mock. API client (`api.ts`) with Bearer auth token fetched from `GET /token` (hardcoded 127.0.0.1 IP check). Reactive gateway store with automatic health check and reconnection. VM store polls `GET /status` every 2s with visibility-aware pause. All view components (Stats, Logs, Files, Inspector) wired to gateway API with transparent mock fallback on network error. Terminal WebSocket connection via iframe postMessage handshake with `?token=` query-param auth (allowlisted, other params dropped). VM lifecycle actions (stop/delete/fork/resume) wired in both toolbar and new-tab page. Connection status dot in toolbar. Gateway-side: added `GET /token` endpoint with loopback IP restriction, added query-param auth fallback for WebSocket paths only. Settings remains mock (service has no settings CRUD API yet). 115 gateway tests, 303 frontend tests passing.

### Added
- **Theme system** -- three independent axes: UI mode (auto/light/dark), accent color (9 options), and terminal theme (12 families with dark/light variants). All persisted in localStorage. Terminal themes sourced from canonical iTerm2-Color-Schemes palettes. Accent colors are primary-only CSS overrides on a single consistent dark/light base (removed ~2000 lines of per-theme Preline CSS). Settings page with Interface and Terminal subsections, color swatches, and live terminal preview.
- **Bundled fonts** -- Google Sans Flex for UI chrome, Google Sans Code as default terminal font, plus JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Cascadia Code, Inconsolata, Hack, Space Mono, Ubuntu Mono. All local TTF in `public/fonts/`, zero external loads. Terminal font and font size configurable in Settings with localStorage persistence and iframe propagation via postMessage.
- **Auto Docker GC** -- `_docker-gc` recipe runs automatically after `build-assets`, `cross-compile`, and `test-install` to prevent unbounded disk growth. Prunes stopped containers, unused images >72h, build cache >72h, and runs `fstrim` on the Colima VM disk to release freed space back to macOS.
- **Doctor: separate CLI vs daemon checks** -- `just doctor` now checks the Docker CLI binary and daemon reachability independently, with platform-specific fix hints (macOS: start Colima, Linux: systemctl start docker).
- **Shell completions and `capsem uninstall`** -- `capsem completions bash|zsh|fish` generates shell completions via clap_complete. `capsem uninstall --yes` stops service, removes unit, binaries, `~/.capsem/`, and logs.
- **`capsem update` self-update** -- checks GitHub for new releases, downloads assets with hash verification, and cleans up old versions. Update notice displayed on every command (24h cached check). `--yes` skips confirmation. Development builds directed to build from source. Install layout detection (MacosPkg, UserDir, Development).
- **`capsem setup` interactive wizard** -- first-time setup with security preset selection, AI provider credential detection, repository access check, service installation, and PATH verification. Supports `--non-interactive`, `--preset`, `--force`, `--accept-detected`, and `--corp-config` flags. Persists state to `~/.capsem/setup-state.json` for incremental re-runs. Corp-aware: skips prompts for corp-locked settings.
- **Corp config provisioning** -- enterprise users can provision corp config from a URL or local file path via `capsem setup --corp-config`. Config installs to `~/.capsem/corp.toml` with source metadata in `corp-source.json`. Background refresh with ETag-based conditional GET. Loader now merges system (`/etc/capsem/corp.toml`) and user-provisioned (`~/.capsem/corp.toml`) corp configs with system taking precedence per-key.
- **Remote manifest fetch and background asset download** -- `fetch_remote_manifest()` and `fetch_latest_manifest()` fetch VM asset manifests from GitHub releases. `start_background_download()` spawns a tokio task that checks and downloads missing assets with progress reporting via an mpsc channel. Reuses existing AssetManager, DownloadProgress, and blake3 verification.
- **`capsem service install/uninstall/status`** -- register capsem as a LaunchAgent (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux) with `capsem service install`. Pure generator functions produce the plist/unit content; side-effecting functions handle platform registration. Auto-launch prefers the service manager when a unit is installed.
- **CLI auto-launches service on first command** -- `capsem list` (or any command) now auto-starts the service daemon if no socket is found. Tries systemd/LaunchAgent if a unit is installed, falls back to direct spawn. New `paths` module discovers sibling binaries and assets with installed-first resolution (`~/.capsem/assets/`) before dev fallback. MCP server also uses installed-first asset resolution. Consolidated CLI HTTP methods into a single `request()` with retry-on-connect-fail.
- **Native installer e2e test harness** -- Docker-based install test infrastructure with systemd user sessions. `just install` builds and installs to `~/.capsem/` with codesigning on macOS. `just test-install` runs the full install layout tests in a Docker container. `capsem version` now prints a unique build hash (`capsem 0.16.1 (build c37b920.1775464335)`) for binary identity verification. CI runs install tests on every PR; release pipeline gates on them.
- **Fork images** -- snapshot running or stopped VMs into reusable template images (`capsem fork`), boot new VMs from them (`capsem create --image`). Image registry with list/inspect/delete. Flat genealogy model (images depend only on base squashfs, never on each other). Asset cleanup protects referenced squashfs versions. Available via CLI, MCP tools (`capsem_fork`, `capsem_image_list`, `capsem_image_inspect`, `capsem_image_delete`), and service HTTP API.
- **Session DB schema v5** -- adds `source_image` and `persistent` columns. Vacuum skips persistent VM sessions.
- **CLI parity sprint** -- `--timeout` on `exec`, `capsem version`, `-q`/`--quiet` on `list`, `--tail N` on `logs`, `capsem restart` for persistent VMs, `--env KEY=VALUE` / `-e` on `create` for guest environment injection.
- **`--env` plumbing** -- environment variables flow from CLI/MCP through service, process, and into guest boot config (`send_boot_config`). Supports up to 128 env vars per VM.
- **MCP: `capsem_version` tool** -- returns MCP server version and service connectivity status.
- **MCP: `tail` parameter** -- on `capsem_vm_logs` and `capsem_service_logs` tools, limit output to last N lines (applied after grep filter).
- **MCP: `env` parameter** -- on `capsem_create` tool, inject environment variables into the guest.
- **Next-gen daemon architecture (Sprint 1)** -- capsem now runs as a daemon service (`capsem-service`) that spawns isolated per-VM processes (`capsem-process`), mirroring Chrome's multi-process security model. The service manages VM lifecycle over a UDS API, while each process boots and owns exactly one VM.
- **Full CLI client (`capsem`)** -- new subcommands: `start`, `stop`, `shell`, `list`/`ls`, `status`, `exec`, `delete`/`rm`, `info`, `logs`, `doctor`. The CLI communicates with the service daemon over `~/.capsem/service.sock`.
- **`capsem-mcp` crate** -- standalone MCP server (stdio transport via `rmcp`) that bridges AI agent tool calls to the service API. Provides `capsem_create`, `capsem_exec`, `capsem_read_file`, `capsem_write_file`, `capsem_list`, `capsem_delete`, `capsem_info`, `capsem_service_logs`, `capsem_vm_logs` tools.
- **Structured IPC protocol** -- `capsem-proto` extended with `Exec`, `WriteFile`, `ReadFile`, `ReloadConfig`, `StartTerminalStream` commands and matching result variants. New `ipc_ext` module in `capsem-core` for framed message helpers.
- **Service-level resource management** -- concurrent VM limit (`max_concurrent_vms`), per-VM CPU/RAM validation (1-8 CPUs, 256MB-16GB), stale instance cleanup, auto-remove flag, socket path length validation.
- **Multi-version asset resolution** -- service resolves assets from `~/.capsem/assets/v{version}/` with arch-specific fallback.
- **Network policy config: builder tests** -- comprehensive unit tests for `settings_to_vm_settings`, `settings_to_domain_rules`, `load_merged_settings`, and preset validation.
- **Session maintenance** -- new cleanup routines in `capsem-core` for session directory housekeeping.
- **Testing sprint Phase 3 complete** -- 11 new test suites (T15-T25) covering build chain E2E, guest validation, cleanup verification, codesign strict, serial console, session.db lifecycle, config runtime, recipe smoke, recovery/crash-resilience, rootfs artifacts, and exhaustive per-table session.db validation. ~84 new Python integration tests across 40+ test files.
- **New just recipes for Phase 3 tests** -- `test-build-chain`, `test-guest`, `test-cleanup`, `test-codesign`, `test-serial`, `test-session-lifecycle`, `test-config-runtime`, `test-recipes`, `test-recovery`, `test-rootfs`, `test-session-exhaustive`, plus a combined `test-vm` recipe.

### Changed
- **`capsem-process` is now the VM owner** -- boot logic moved from `capsem-app` into `capsem-process`, which receives config via CLI args and communicates with the service over a typed IPC channel (`tokio-unix-ipc`). Includes PTY exec with ANSI stripping, file I/O forwarding, and terminal streaming.
- **`capsem-agent` guest binary** -- updated vsock I/O, net proxy, and MCP server modules to match the new host-guest protocol.
- **Justfile overhaul** -- restructured recipes for the daemon workflow (`run-service`, `run-process`), updated build and test targets.

### Fixed
- **Silent epoch on malformed image timestamps** -- `time_format` serde deserializer silently returned `UNIX_EPOCH` for garbage input, corrupting image sort order. Now returns a proper deserialization error.
- **`top_mcp_tools` merged tools from different servers** -- SQL `GROUP BY tool_name` without `server_name` collapsed cross-server tools into one row with an arbitrary server name. Added `server_name` to the GROUP BY clause.
- **Image registry TOCTOU and concurrent write corruption** -- `create_image_from_session` had a TOCTOU race (exists check then create_dir_all). Replaced with atomic `create_dir`. Added `flock`-based file locking around registry insert/remove with atomic write (write-to-temp then rename).
- **`handle_logs` returned 404 for stopped persistent VMs** -- unlike `handle_info`, it only checked running instances. Added persistent registry fallback.
- **Blocking I/O in async context** -- `std::thread::sleep` in CLI shell loop (replaced with `tokio::time::sleep`), `std::process::Command` in MCP service relaunch (replaced with `tokio::process::Command`), blocking file reads in MCP `service_logs` and service `handle_logs` (wrapped in `spawn_blocking`).
- **CLI `SandboxInfo` missing fields** -- CLI struct lacked `ram_mb`, `cpus`, `version` fields that the service returns. Added with `#[serde(default)]` and display in `status` command.
- **Panicking `unwrap()` in MCP service relaunch** -- `Path::parent().unwrap()` replaced with proper error propagation.
- **`snapshots` CLI missing from release rootfs** -- the `snapshots` tool was never copied into the rootfs Docker build context or Dockerfile template, so release builds shipped without it. Added `ROOTFS_ARTIFACTS` constant as single source of truth in `docker.py`, plus 6 validation layers: builder unit tests, builder doctor pre-build check, config validator, rootfs artifacts test suite, CI release workflow validation, and in-VM guest binary assertions (changed from `pytest.skip` to `pytest.fail`).
- **`just doctor-fix` fails on fresh machines** -- `build-assets` triggered `_ensure-setup` which ran `doctor` which failed on missing assets, creating a circular dependency. Fix commands now set `CAPSEM_SKIP_ASSET_CHECK=1` and `touch .dev-setup` to break the cycle. Guest binary checks are also skipped when asset check is skipped (no assets = no binaries). Fixes bail on first failure instead of continuing to run dependent steps.
- **Docker cross-arch builds fail (legacy builder cache poisoning)** -- Docker's legacy builder shared intermediate layer cache across `--platform` values, reusing arm64 layers for x86_64 builds. Fixed by requiring Docker BuildKit (buildx). Added buildx and Colima Rosetta checks to `just doctor` and `bootstrap.sh`.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **KVM boot diagnostics** -- when vCPU creation fails on Linux, Capsem now runs automatic diagnostic probes: kernel version, nested KVM status, KVM capabilities, and a fresh-VM-without-IRQCHIP test to isolate the root cause. All results logged at ERROR level so they appear without `RUST_LOG=debug`.
- **`build_system/scripts/doctor/kvm-diagnostic.py`** -- standalone diagnostic script for manual KVM environment debugging. Tests 7 phases: /dev/kvm basics, capabilities, Capsem boot sequence, no-irqchip mode, reversed ordering, split IRQCHIP, and environment info.

### Fixed
- **KVM boot errors are now actionable** -- `/dev/kvm` missing explains how to enable KVM (modprobe, BIOS). Permission denied suggests `usermod -aG kvm`. EEXIST on vCPU creation explains restricted/nested KVM and points to the diagnostic script.
- **Linux boot failure shows macOS error message** -- `gui.rs` said "unsigned binary or missing entitlement" on all platforms. Now shows platform-specific guidance: KVM troubleshooting on Linux, entitlement info on macOS.
- **LATEST_RELEASE.md stale at v0.15.1** -- boot screen showed wrong version. Regenerated from CHANGELOG.md.

### Changed
- **`just doctor` rewritten as standalone scripts** -- moved from 265-line inline justfile recipe to `build_system/scripts/doctor/doctor-common.sh` + platform-specific `doctor-macos.sh` and `doctor-linux.sh`. Colored output (green/red/yellow), structured recap table, and auto-fix: detects fixable issues (missing rustup targets, cargo tools, broken symlinks) and prompts to fix them automatically. `--fix` flag for non-interactive auto-fix.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **`just clean` reports freed space** -- shows per-directory sizes before deletion and total freed at the end. Also cleans `tmp/` and `coverage/` directories.
- **`just clean-all` prunes docker volumes** -- adds `--volumes` to docker prune for full reclaim.
- **Automatic incremental cache trimming** -- `_clean-stale` now checks if `target/` exceeds 20 GB and auto-removes incremental compilation caches (`target/debug/incremental`, `target/release/incremental`, `target/llvm-cov-target`). Prevents unbounded growth that caused 113 GB bloat.
- **`_clean-stale` wired into all build paths** -- added to `build-assets` and `cross-compile` dependency chains (was already in `test` and `_compile`).
- **Revert telemetry** -- `snapshots_revert` now logs a `restored` file event to the session DB, including the source checkpoint (e.g., `"src/main.py (from cp-3)"`). New `FileAction::Restored` variant in capsem-logger, `FileEventStats.restored` counter in reader queries.
- **Boot audit logging** -- comprehensive `[boot-audit]` tracing throughout the GUI and CLI boot paths (main.rs, gui.rs, boot.rs, cli.rs, session_mgmt.rs). Every step from session cleanup through hypervisor boot is timestamped, making hangs immediately diagnosable.
- **Doctor: VM asset and guest binary checks** -- `just doctor` now validates asset manifest version, B3SUM integrity, and guest binary presence/format.
- **Smoke test recipe** -- `just smoke-test` (alias `just smoke`) runs unit tests + repack + sign + capsem-doctor as a fast end-to-end validation without full asset rebuild.
- **Doctor: Docker BuildKit (buildx) and Colima Rosetta checks** -- `just doctor` now validates that buildx is installed and Colima has Rosetta enabled for cross-arch container builds.

### Fixed
- **Cross-arch Docker builds fail on macOS** -- Docker's legacy builder shared intermediate layer cache across `--platform` values, causing arm64 layers to be reused for x86_64 builds. Fixed by requiring Docker BuildKit (buildx), which properly includes platform in cache keys. Added buildx to `just doctor` and `bootstrap.sh`.
- **Snapshots tab shows nothing during long sessions** -- the tab called `callMcpTool('snapshots_list')` once on mount, never refreshed, and failed silently if the MCP gateway wasn't wired yet. An intermediate implementation used SQL rows, but the current 1.3 contract supersedes that: snapshot state is exposed through VM snapshot routes and is not stored in `session.db`.
- **Symlink loop hangs app on startup** -- `disk_usage_bytes()` used `is_dir()` / `metadata()` which follow symlinks. A `.venv/lib64 -> lib` relative symlink in session workspaces caused infinite recursion, hanging the app at boot. Fixed to use `symlink_metadata()` throughout. Added regression tests for symlink loops, absolute escapes, and real session timing.
- **Wizard flashes briefly on app launch** -- the setup wizard appeared for one frame before settings finished loading. Added `!settingsStore.loading` guard to prevent the wizard from rendering until settings are fully resolved.
- **KVM boot path compile errors** -- `vm/boot.rs` referenced `rootfs_path()` and `virtiofs_share()` methods that were renamed. Fixed to use `disk_path()` and `virtio_fs_share()`.
- **capsem-cli missing `mut`** -- `socket.read(&resp_buf)` needed `&mut resp_buf`.

### Security
- **Symlink sandbox escape (documented)** -- guest agents can create symlinks through VirtioFS that point to arbitrary host paths (e.g., `host_root -> /`). Host-side code that follows these symlinks escapes the sandbox. `disk_usage_bytes` is fixed; 6 other code paths identified and documented in `tmp/bugs/symlink_escape.md` for hardening.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **x86_64 CI boot test fails on restricted KVM** -- GitHub Actions runners expose `/dev/kvm` but lack full VM support (no CPUID, no PIT). The boot test now probes KVM capability before attempting a VM boot and skips gracefully with a warning annotation when the runner's KVM is insufficient.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **x86_64 boot test fails on CI: KVM_CREATE_PIT2 unsupported** -- GitHub Actions runners use restricted KVM that doesn't support the legacy i8254 PIT timer. Made PIT creation optional with a warning; when unavailable, `no_timer_check` is appended to the kernel cmdline so Linux uses alternative timer sources.
- **`cross-compile` missing boot test** -- CI installs the `.deb` and boot-tests with capsem-doctor but `cross-compile` didn't. Added boot test step that runs when `/dev/kvm` is available and the target matches the native arch; skips on macOS or cross-arch builds.
- **`cross-compile` missing GNU cross-linker config** -- `.cargo/config.toml` only had musl linker entries. Added `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc` and `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` for GNU targets used by the Tauri app build.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **x86_64 Linux build fails: aarch64 boot module not cfg-gated** -- `mod boot` (ARM64 kernel loading, FDT, register setup) was included unconditionally, causing 14 compile errors on x86_64 (`set_one_reg`, `REG_PC`, `KERNEL_TEXT_OFFSET` not found). Gated with `#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]`.
- **Cross-compile linker error on arm64 hosts** -- building `capsem-agent` for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` inside the Docker container used the native `cc` (arm64) which doesn't understand `-m64`. Added `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc` and `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` cross-linker entries to `.cargo/config.toml`.
- **Multiarch dpkg conflict in cross-compile Docker image** -- `libpango1.0-dev` arm64-to-amd64 swap failed on shared `.gir` file. Added `--force-overwrite` to `swap-dev-libs.sh`.

### Changed
- **`build-assets` builds both arm64 and x86_64** -- previously only built for the native architecture, so cross-compile for the other arch always failed locally due to missing VM assets.
- **`full-test` includes `cross-compile`** -- catches platform-gating errors before tagging instead of discovering them in CI.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **x86_64 KVM backend** -- full KVM support for x86_64 Linux: bzImage boot protocol, identity-mapped page tables, GDT, IRQCHIP/PIT interrupt controller, CPUID passthrough, 16550 UART serial console (PIO), E820 memory map, virtio-mmio device discovery via kernel cmdline. The .deb now boots VMs on both aarch64 and x86_64.
- **Cross-compile Docker image** -- purpose-built `capsem-host-builder` image (Ubuntu 24.04) with all Tauri build deps pre-baked (system libs, Node.js 24, pnpm 10, Rust stable, cargo tools, uv). Replaces the old `rust:bookworm` ad-hoc install approach. Named volumes cache cargo registry and per-arch build artifacts between runs. New recipes: `just build-host-image`, `just clean-host-image`.
- **x86_64 release boot test** -- release pipeline now boot-tests the x86_64 .deb with capsem-doctor before publishing.
- **Compile-time KVM struct size assertions** -- `const _` assertions for all KVM ioctl structs (both aarch64 and x86_64) that fail at compile time, not runtime.
- **Kernel arch-mismatch detection** -- x86_64 boot rejects ARM64 Image kernels, aarch64 boot rejects bzImage kernels, with clear error messages instead of cryptic crashes.

### Changed
- **Container runtime: Podman replaced with Colima + Docker CLI** -- macOS now uses Colima (Apple Virtualization.framework with Rosetta) instead of Podman (libkrun). Rosetta gives near-native x86_64 container performance on Apple Silicon, making cross-arch kernel and rootfs builds much faster. All podman-specific code paths removed; standardized on `docker` CLI everywhere.

### Fixed
- **`just run` blocked on Linux** -- the `_sign` recipe hard-exited on non-macOS, preventing `just run`, `just bench`, and `just full-test` from working on Linux with KVM. Now skips codesigning on Linux.
- **x86_64 KVM boot broken: wrong entry point + missing setup header** -- the 64-bit entry point was `KERNEL_LOAD_ADDR` instead of `KERNEL_LOAD_ADDR + 0x200` (`startup_64`), causing the vCPU to execute 32-bit code in long mode and hang. Fixed by preserving bzImage setup header into boot_params and correcting the entry point.
- **`install.sh` fails on Linux** -- added OS and architecture detection so the same one-liner works on both macOS (arm64 .dmg) and Linux (x86_64/arm64 .deb via `apt install`).
- **Site docs claim macOS-only** -- updated to reflect Linux/KVM support.
- **`.cargo/config.toml` not tracked** -- broke codesigning on fresh clones. Fixed by anchoring the gitignore pattern to root.
- **Boot screen showed "No release notes available"** -- replaced Vite plugin path with `LATEST_RELEASE.md` generated by `cut-release`.
- **No error screen when VM assets fail** -- added proper error state to the boot screen with trigger-specific messages.

## [0.14.20] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **CI release upload collision on per-arch VM assets** -- `gh release upload "$f#${arch}-${base}"` sets the display label, not the filename. Both arches uploaded `initrd.img`, causing a name collision. Fixed by renaming files to `${arch}-${base}` before upload.

## [0.14.19] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **AI CLI version check fails in CI** -- `extract_tool_versions()` runs `gemini --version` and `codex --version` inside the built rootfs image, but `/opt/ai-clis/bin` was not on the container PATH. Added `ENV PATH` to the Dockerfile template after npm CLI install so version extraction finds the binaries.
- **`cut-release` skipped container build** -- `cut-release` depended on `just test` (unit tests only), so Dockerfile and rootfs issues were only caught by CI after tagging. Now `cut-release` depends on `full-test`, which depends on `build-assets`. The full chain (container build + unit tests + capsem-doctor + integration + bench) runs locally before any tag is created.
- **Container agent build fails writing Cargo.lock** -- source mounted `:ro` prevented cargo from generating `Cargo.lock`. Switched to symlinking source into writable `/build` dir so cargo can write the lockfile without modifying the host.

## [0.14.18] - 2026-03-30

### Changed
- **Config-driven tool version extraction** -- `extract_tool_versions()` now builds its shell script from TOML configs (`version_commands` fields) instead of a hardcoded tool list. Covers build tools (node, npm, uv, pip), apt packages (git, python3, gh, tmux, curl), Python packages (pytest, numpy, requests, pandas), and AI CLIs (claude, gemini, codex) with grouped output in tool-versions.txt. Build-time validation catches silent install failures (N/A) for enabled AI CLIs. New W013 diagnostic warns when an AI provider has a CLI but no `version_command`.

### Fixed
- **VM asset download fails with arch-prefixed release names** -- CI uploads per-arch assets as `arm64-rootfs.squashfs` etc., but `AssetManager` constructed download URLs with bare filenames (`rootfs.squashfs`), causing 404s. Added `arch_prefix` to `AssetManager` so download URLs match the release naming convention. Local storage still uses bare filenames.

## [0.14.17] - 2026-03-30

## [0.14.16] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **CI test job: create stub assets for Tauri build.rs** -- the parallelization commit removed asset downloads from test, but `cargo test --workspace` compiles capsem-app whose build.rs needs assets/manifest.json. Was masked by Rust cache until tauri.conf.json change invalidated it.
- **CI create-release cleanup** -- removed stale AppImage/updater references (latest.json merge, tar.gz/sig collection), fixed SBOM attestation to cover both DMG and deb, fixed test summary to parse `cargo llvm-cov` output format, prefix per-arch VM assets (`arm64-vmlinuz`, `x86_64-vmlinuz`) to avoid upload name collisions.

## [0.14.15] - 2026-03-30

## [0.14.14] - 2026-03-30

## [0.14.13] - 2026-03-30

### Improved
- **CI pipeline parallelized (~18 min vs ~45 min)** -- test runs in parallel with build-assets and app builds. Test gates create-release but doesn't block compilation. Removed redundant cross-compile check and asset downloads from test job.

### Fixed
- **Pin Xcode 16.2 on macOS CI runners** -- Xcode 15.4's xcodebuild crashes with `Abort trap: 6` when Tauri tries to locate notarytool. Runner image update broke the default Xcode between v0.14.11 (passed) and v0.14.12 (failed). Explicitly selecting Xcode 16.2 prevents runner drift.
- **Drop AppImage from Linux releases** -- linuxdeploy cannot run on GitHub CI runners (Ubuntu 24.04 lacks FUSE2, and neither `libfuse2` nor `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` resolves it reliably). Linux ships `.deb` only on both arm64 and x86_64. Root cause of every v0.14.x Linux build failure (14 consecutive failed releases).
- **Container agent build: replace `file` with `ls -l`** -- `file` command is not available in `rust:slim-bookworm`. Binary verification now uses `ls -l` (coreutils); real validation (existence + non-zero size) is done in Python after the container exits.
- **Broken capsem-doctor link in docs** -- getting-started page linked to `/testing/capsem-doctor/` (removed section) instead of `/debugging/capsem-doctor/`.
- **Site description outdated** -- splash page and meta description now mention Linux (KVM) support added in v0.14.
- **Security docs sidebar ordering** -- three security pages lacked `sidebar.order`, causing alphabetical sort instead of logical progression.
- **`.dockerignore` untracked** -- Docker builds on CI or fresh clones were copying `target/`, `node_modules/`, `.venv/` into build context.

## [0.14.12] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Skip AppImage on arm64 Linux** -- linuxdeploy has no arm64 build. arm64 Linux (Chromebooks) now builds `.deb` only. x86_64 builds both deb + AppImage.

## [0.14.11] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **CI Linux build: add Tauri signing keys** -- `build-app-linux` was missing `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, causing "public key found but no private key" failure. Also collect `.tar.gz` and `.sig` updater artifacts.

### Added
- **`just cross-compile [arch]`** -- build agent binaries + full Linux app (deb + AppImage) inside a container. No host cross-compile toolchain needed. Supports arm64 and x86_64. Clean build every run (no stale volumes).
- **Container-native agent compilation** -- builds natively inside a Linux container, eliminating cross-compile cfg gating issues.
- **Multi-arch Linux release** -- CI now builds deb + AppImage for both arm64 and x86_64 via matrix job. Artifacts validated with `dpkg-deb --info` and `file`.

## [0.14.10] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **CI Linux build: install xdg-utils** -- Tauri's AppImage bundler requires `xdg-open`. Added `xdg-utils` to `apt-get install` in `build-app-linux`.
- **Linux build: gate all macOS-only APIs** -- `ApfsSnapshot` (`libc::clonefile`), `AppleVzHypervisor` import in boot.rs, and `vm_integration.rs` tests were not `cfg`-gated, causing compile failures on Linux app builds. Boot now dispatches to `KvmHypervisor` on Linux.
- **Builder: apt clock skew on macOS** -- Podman/Docker VM clock drift after sleep/wake caused `apt-get update` to reject release files as "not valid yet" (exit 100). Added `Acquire::Check-Date=false` to all apt-get calls in Dockerfile templates and squashfs creation. Also added `sync_container_clock()` to auto-sync the VM clock with the host before builds.

### Added
- **Platform gating static analysis test** -- `cargo test --test platform_gating` scans all `.rs` files for ungated macOS-only and Linux-only symbols. Catches platform API issues before they reach CI.
- **Builder doctor: container clock check** -- `capsem-builder doctor` now detects clock skew between host and container VM, reports direction and magnitude, and suggests a fix.

### Improved
- **Boot timing display** -- formatted table with right-aligned columns and proportional bar chart instead of flat log lines.
- **capsem-bench refactored to package** -- split 897-line single file into `capsem_bench/` Python package with per-category modules (disk, rootfs, startup, http_bench, throughput, snapshot). Shell wrapper at `capsem-bench` preserves the same CLI interface.
- **capsem-bench JSON output** -- saved to `/tmp/capsem-benchmark.json` inside the VM instead of dumped to stdout.

### Docs
- **Site restructuring** -- moved capsem-doctor to new top-level Debugging section (with troubleshooting guide), moved benchmarking methodology to Development, added top-level Benchmarks section with current performance results (boot time, disk I/O, CLI startup, HTTP, throughput, snapshots).

## [0.14.8] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Linux build: gate all macOS-only APIs** -- `ApfsSnapshot` (`libc::clonefile`) and `AppleVzHypervisor` import in boot.rs were not `cfg`-gated, causing compile failures on Linux app builds. Boot now dispatches to `KvmHypervisor` on Linux.

## [0.14.7] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Linux build: gate `ApfsSnapshot` behind `cfg(target_os = "macos")`** -- `libc::clonefile` is macOS-only, causing compile failure on Linux app builds.

## [0.14.6] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **CI build-assets restores Rust toolchain** -- v0.14.5 removed `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` when switching to just recipes, but `build-rootfs` cross-compiles the guest agent and needs the musl target installed.
- **CI build-assets builds both kernel and rootfs** -- release workflow only built rootfs, missing vmlinuz and initrd.img. Now uses `just build-kernel` and `just build-rootfs` recipes instead of reimplementing build logic.
- **CI assets/current ordering** -- moved `cp -r` after `generate_checksums` so Tauri's `build.rs` finds real files instead of a stripped symlink.

### Improved
- **`just doctor` codesigning diagnostics** -- new four-step Codesigning section checks Xcode CLTools, codesign binary, entitlements.plist, and runs a real test sign. Every `[FAIL]` line now includes a copy-pasteable fix command.
- **`bootstrap.sh` platform checks** -- macOS: validates Xcode Command Line Tools. Linux: prints informational notice about which recipes work (test, build-assets, audit) vs require macOS (run, dev, bench).
- **`_sign` recipe platform guard** -- fails immediately on Linux with actionable message instead of cryptic "codesign: command not found".
- **`run_signed.sh` error surfacing** -- codesign failures now print to stderr with a hint to run `just doctor`, instead of silently logging to `target/build.log`.
- **Developer getting-started docs** -- added platform requirements table, codesigning section with validation table, and codesign troubleshooting to the site.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **KVM virtio_blk split-borrow** -- `queue_notify` uses `.take()` pattern to avoid split-borrow when processing read/write/get_id operations.
- **CI release uses cp -r for assets/current** -- GitHub Actions artifacts strip symlinks, causing the `ln -s` approach to fail. Switched to `cp -r`.
- **Builder checksums handle current/ as directory** -- `generate_checksums()` now removes `current/` whether it's a symlink or a directory (from a prior `cp -r`).
- **Guest agent `libc::time_t` deprecation** -- replaced deprecated `libc::time_t` with `i64` in vsock_io timeout constant.

### Added
- **Developer getting-started documentation** -- full setup guide at capsem.org/development/getting-started/ covering prerequisites, container runtime setup, cross-compilation, and troubleshooting.
- **Bootstrap script** -- `bootstrap.sh` checks all required tools, installs Python and frontend deps, and runs `just doctor`.
- **`.dev-setup` sentinel** -- `just doctor` writes a `.dev-setup` file on success. All recipes (`run`, `test`, `dev`, `bench`) auto-run doctor if the sentinel is missing, preventing new developers from skipping setup.
- **`uv` check in `just doctor`** -- doctor now validates that `uv` is installed (previously missing, causing silent `build-assets` failures).
- **README prerequisites** -- "Build from source" section now lists required tools and links to the full development guide.
- **`dev-start` skill** -- quick-start pointer skill for new developers.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Builder uses Python blake3 for checksums** -- `generate_checksums()` no longer shells out to `b3sum` CLI. Uses the `blake3` Python library directly, making the builder self-contained in CI environments.
- **Site workflow uses pnpm 10** -- pnpm 9 errored with workspace detection issues.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Hypervisor abstraction layer** -- `Hypervisor`, `VmHandle`, `SerialConsole` traits in new `hypervisor` module. Platform-agnostic `VsockConnection` with lifetime anchor pattern.
- **KVM backend** -- embedded VMM using rust-vmm crates (`kvm-ioctls`, `vm-memory`, `linux-loader`). Virtio console, block, vsock (vhost-vsock), and VirtioFS (embedded FUSE server) devices. GICv3 interrupt controller, FDT generation, multi-vCPU support. ~5,500 LOC.
- **Linux app builds** -- Tauri deb and AppImage targets. macOS-only dependencies gated behind `cfg(target_os = "macos")`. CFRunLoop pumping replaced with platform-agnostic sleep on Linux.
- **capsem-builder Python package** -- config-driven build system for guest VM images. Pydantic models for all TOML configs, Jinja2 Dockerfile renderer (rootfs + kernel, multi-arch), compiler-style validation linter, Click CLI, scaffolding, BOM manifest, vulnerability audit parsing, MCP stdio server, and build doctor. 408 tests at 97% coverage.
- **capsem-builder CLI** -- `validate`, `build`, `inspect`, `init`, `add`, `audit`, `new`, `mcp`, and `doctor` commands.
- **Docker build execution** -- `capsem-builder build` produces real VM assets (kernel, initrd, rootfs squashfs). Config-driven multi-architecture output to per-arch subdirectories (`assets/arm64/`, `assets/x86_64/`).
- **Guest image TOML configs** -- declarative configs in `guest/config/` replacing hardcoded values: `build.toml` (multi-arch), `ai/*.toml` (3 providers), `packages/*.toml`, `mcp/*.toml`, `security/web.toml`, `vm/resources.toml`, `vm/environment.toml`, `kernel/defconfig.*` (arm64 + x86_64).
- **Jinja2 Dockerfile templates** -- `Dockerfile.rootfs.j2` and `Dockerfile.kernel.j2` render multi-arch Dockerfiles from TOML configs. 51 conformance tests verify parity with hand-authored Dockerfiles.
- **Settings schema (Pydantic)** -- canonical schema source with two-node-type design (GroupNode + SettingNode). JSON Schema generation, cross-language golden fixtures with Python/Rust/TypeScript conformance tests (99 tests).
- **Config-driven settings grammar** -- formalized TOML grammar with Group, Leaf, and Action node types. Settings UI fully data-driven.
- **Batch settings IPC** -- `load_settings` and `save_settings` Tauri commands replace 3 parallel calls with 1.
- **SettingsModel TypeScript class** -- pure TS class with settings logic, fully unit-tested (43 tests).
- **Snapshot benchmarks** -- `capsem-bench snapshot` measures create/list/changes/revert/delete latency at 10/100/500 file workspace sizes.
- **Direct clonefile(2) syscall** -- `ApfsSnapshot` uses `libc::clonefile()` directly. Snapshot create dropped from 50ms to 3.7ms (93% faster).
- **Hardlink-based incremental snapshots** -- `SnapshotBackend` trait with `ApfsSnapshot` (macOS) and `HardlinkSnapshot` (cross-platform) implementations.
- **FUSE ops unit tests** -- 30+ tests covering file I/O, directory operations, metadata, and adversarial cases.
- **Doctor session validation test** -- `build_system/scripts/doctor/doctor_session_test.py` verifies session.db telemetry after capsem-doctor run.
- **Container runtime resource checks** -- `just doctor` and `capsem-builder doctor` verify podman/Docker have enough memory (min 4GB).
- **Asset resolution test suite** -- 28 new tests across Rust and Python for manifest parsing, hash verification, and per-arch resolution.
- **`manifest_compat` module** -- shared `extract_hashes()` for manifest hash extraction, testable independently from `build.rs`.
- **Multi-arch asset selection** -- host app detects architecture at compile time and loads assets from per-arch subdirectories. Backward compatible with flat layout.
- **Asset pipeline documentation** -- new site page and skill documenting the build-to-boot asset flow.
- **Hypervisor architecture documentation** -- boot sequence, KVM internals, virtio device slots, VirtioFS server. Five mermaid diagrams.
- **Capsem-doctor documentation** -- 11 test categories, test infrastructure, adding new tests.
- **Corporate image support** -- custom guest configs produce different images (6 corporate image tests).
- **Persistent MCP client** -- `snapshots` CLI reuses a single fastmcp Client across all tool calls.

### Changed
- **Multi-arch release pipeline** -- CI builds arm64 and x86_64 VM assets in parallel on native runners. Per-arch attestation. Unified manifest with both architectures.
- **Release workflow adds Linux builds** -- separate `build-app-linux` job produces deb and AppImage alongside macOS DMG.
- **Site deployment fixed** -- workflow switched from npm to pnpm, Node pinned to 24.
- Apple Virtualization.framework code moved to `hypervisor/apple_vz/` behind `cfg(target_os = "macos")` gate. macOS-only dependencies now target-conditional.
- `VsockManager` replaced by `mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<VsockConnection>` returned from `Hypervisor::boot()`.
- `auto_snapshot` uses `SnapshotBackend` trait (APFS clonefile on macOS, recursive copy elsewhere).
- `notify` crate uses default features (cross-platform) instead of macOS-only `macos_fsevent`.
- Claude Code installed via native installer (`curl` instead of `npm`). Binary in `/usr/local/bin/` (chmod 555).
- Builder cleans up container images after extracting assets.
- Guest artifacts moved to `guest/artifacts/` from `images/`.
- `just build-assets` now uses capsem-builder with config-driven Dockerfile generation.
- Multi-arch cross-compilation configured for both `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`.
- Multi-arch diagnostics accept both `aarch64` and `x86_64`.
- Linux KVM backend promoted to Production status.
- CI coverage tracking for Linux KVM backend (`linux-unit` Codecov flag).
- Settings grammar documented with full specification.
- Settings architecture page with 7 mermaid diagrams.
- Side effect dispatch driven by metadata instead of hardcoded checks.
- MCP injection generalized for multiple servers from config.
- Site: mermaid diagram support via `astro-mermaid`.
- Skills table added to CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md.
- `cut-release` recipe now bumps `pyproject.toml` alongside Cargo.toml and tauri.conf.json.
- Preflight checks add `uv` tool and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target.
- README updated for multi-platform support (macOS + Linux), documentation links point to capsem.org.

### Fixed
- **Asset manifest format bug** -- `gen_manifest.py` produced filenames like `"arm64/vmlinuz"` instead of bare `"vmlinuz"`, causing `build.rs` to silently skip hash verification.
- **Per-arch manifest parsing** -- `Manifest::from_json()` rejected per-arch format. Added `from_json_for_arch()`.
- **apt clock skew in container builds** -- added `Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false` to all apt calls.
- **Mock data generated from build system** -- settings and MCP data now generated from `config/defaults.json` and Rust `mcp-export` binary instead of hand-crafted mock.
- **`step` metadata field flows to UI** -- was silently dropped from generated JSON.
- **Build log contamination** -- signing and generation scripts now log to `target/build.log`.
- **Snapshot MCP no longer hangs** -- blocking I/O moved to `spawn_blocking` threads.
- **Snapshot panel now displays snapshots** -- frontend now passes `format: "json"`.
- **Vacuum preserves content sessions** -- keeps at least 25 sessions with AI activity.
- **inspect-session shows MCP tool usage** -- per-tool breakdown replaces old view.
- **Integration test Gemini API key handling** -- reads from `~/.capsem/user.toml` as fallback.
- **FS monitor debouncer lost delete events** -- replaced last-write-wins hashmap with event queue.
- **MCP snapshot tools returned unbounded JSON** -- now paginated text tables.
- **Frontend npm audit vulnerabilities** -- pinned transitive deps via pnpm overrides.

### Security
- **Safe FUSE deserialization** -- `read_struct` returns `Option<T>` with hard bounds check in all builds.
- **fsync/flush error propagation** -- returns mapped errno on failure instead of silently succeeding.
- **VirtioFS resource limits** -- file handle cap (4096), read size clamp (1MB), gather buffer limit (2MB).
- **Async VirtioFS worker thread** -- FUSE processing on dedicated thread, irqfd interrupt delivery, virtqueue memory barriers.
- **Security documentation** -- threat model overview and virtualization security pages.

### Removed
- **`images/` directory** -- legacy build files fully replaced by `guest/config/`, `guest/artifacts/`, and `src/capsem/builder/templates/`.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Files and Snapshots tabs broken in GUI mode** -- `FsMonitor` (file watcher) and `AutoSnapshotScheduler` were only started in CLI mode, never wired into the GUI boot path. Both now start automatically when running the Tauri app.
- **Snapshot API tool name mismatch** -- frontend sent `list_snapshots`/`delete_snapshot` but backend expected `snapshots_list`/`snapshots_delete`, causing all snapshot operations to fail silently.

### Changed
- **Snapshots tab revamped** -- unified table replacing separate manual/auto sections. New columns: total changes, added, modified, deleted per snapshot. Change counts sourced from per-snapshot diffs already computed by the backend.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Decomposed god modules into focused sub-modules** -- split `main.rs` (2,722 LOC) into 7 modules (assets, boot, cli, gui, logging, session_mgmt, vsock_wiring); split `policy_config.rs` (5,999 LOC) into 8 sub-modules (types, registry, loader, presets, resolver, builder, lint, tree); split `session.rs` (1,995 LOC) into 3 sub-modules (types, index, maintenance). All existing import paths preserved via re-exports.
- **Decomposed Tauri commands into domain modules** -- split `commands.rs` (1,425 LOC) into 7 focused modules: terminal, settings, vm_state, session, mcp, logging, utilities. Shared helpers (active_vm_id, reload_all_policies) in mod.rs. All Tauri IPC paths unchanged.
- **Moved AI traffic parsing under `net/`** -- `gateway/` renamed to `net/ai_traffic/` to reflect its role as the MITM proxy's AI parsing layer. All import paths updated.
- **`net_event_counts()` returns a named struct** -- replaced bare `(usize, usize, usize)` tuple with `NetEventCounts { total, allowed, denied }` to prevent field-order bugs.

### Fixed
- **Guest agent vsock I/O no longer hangs on host stall** -- `vsock_connect()` now sets `SO_SNDTIMEO`/`SO_RCVTIMEO` (30s) on all vsock sockets. `write_all_fd` and `read_exact_fd` explicitly handle `EAGAIN` as a fatal timeout, preventing both kernel-level hangs and userspace spin-loops.
- **AsyncVsock double-close bug** -- removed manual `libc::close()` in `Drop` that double-closed the fd already owned by the inner `UnixStream`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **`snapshots` CLI tool** -- in-VM command for managing workspace snapshots (`snapshots create/list/changes/history/compact/revert/delete`). Uses FastMCP client to talk to the host MCP gateway. Supports `--json` flag for machine-readable output.
- **`snapshots_history` MCP tool** -- shows all versions of a file across snapshots with sequential status (new/modified/unchanged/deleted). Accepts both relative paths and `/root/` prefixed paths.
- **`snapshots_compact` MCP tool** -- merges multiple snapshots into a single new manual snapshot. Newest-file-wins strategy. Deletes source snapshots after compaction, freeing pool slots.
- **Boot timing via vsock** -- capsem-init records per-stage durations as JSONL, PTY agent sends `BootTiming` message to host after boot. Host logs each stage with tracing and emits `boot-timing` event to frontend. Stages: squashfs, virtiofs, overlayfs, workspace, network, net_proxy, deploy, venv, agent_start.
- **Named snapshots** -- `snapshots_create` MCP tool creates named checkpoints with blake3 workspace hash. Manual snapshots are stored in a separate pool from auto snapshots and are never auto-culled.
- **Snapshot management MCP tools** -- 8 namespaced tools: `snapshots_create`, `snapshots_list`, `snapshots_changes`, `snapshots_revert`, `snapshots_delete`, `snapshots_history`, `snapshots_compact`. All prefixed with `snapshots_` to avoid collisions.
- **Snapshots UI tab** -- new tab in StatsView showing auto and manual snapshots with stat cards (total, auto, manual, available slots), delete button for manual snapshots.
- **`call_mcp_tool` Tauri command** -- generic frontend dispatcher for MCP built-in tools. Prepares for Phase 3 daemon MCP server.
- **Configurable snapshot limits** -- `settings.vm.snapshots.auto_max` (default 10), `settings.vm.snapshots.manual_max` (default 12), `settings.vm.snapshots.auto_interval` (default 300s) in the settings registry.
- **Boot time regression test** -- `test_boot_time_under_1s` fails if guest boot exceeds 1 second, catches regressions like the AI CLI copy stall.
- **XSS sanitization on guest data** -- boot timing stage names validated alphanumeric+underscore at both agent and host layers. File event paths reject NUL bytes, path traversal, control chars.
- **88 capsem-doctor MCP tests** -- comprehensive snapshot scenario coverage: modify/delete/recreate flows, copy/move, same-name-different-dirs, edge cases (deep paths, special chars, rapid snaps, 100 files), per-tool edge cases, belt-and-suspenders (MCP + CLI paths).
- Dual-pool snapshot scheduler: auto slots (ring buffer) + manual slots (named, never auto-culled). `SnapshotOrigin` enum (Auto/Manual).

### Changed
- **`snapshots_list` shows per-snapshot diffs** -- changes computed vs previous snapshot (not current workspace), showing what changed AT each snapshot. Includes `files_count` per entry.
- **`snapshots_revert` checkpoint is optional** -- auto-picks latest snapshot containing the file. Errors on "already current" (content + permissions match). Restores file permissions from snapshot.
- **All snapshots include blake3 hash** -- auto snapshots now compute workspace hash (previously manual-only).
- **Path normalization** -- all snapshot tools accept both `hello.txt` and `/root/hello.txt`.
- **AI CLIs use /opt/ai-clis directly** -- eliminated boot-time `cp -a` of hundreds of MB from squashfs to scratch disk. Boot time dropped from multi-second stall to ~530ms.
- **PATH single source of truth** -- `config/defaults.toml` defines PATH (sent via BootConfig SetEnv). Removed duplicate PATH exports from capsem-init, capsem-bashrc, capsem-doctor, profile.d.

### Fixed
- MCP file tools unavailable in GUI mode -- auto-snapshot scheduler was only wired into MCP config in CLI path, never in GUI boot path. Extracted shared `wire_auto_snapshots()` to eliminate duplication.
- `snapshots_list` changes were computed vs current workspace instead of vs previous snapshot
- `snapshots_history` status was computed vs current instead of sequentially
- `snapshots_revert` silently overwrote identical files
- File monitoring and MCP gateway no longer silently disabled when MITM proxy fails -- session DB decoupled from CA/policy loading
- Host file monitor (`FsMonitor`) was dropped immediately after creation, stopping FSEvents watcher
- `FsMonitor::emit` was not awaiting `db.write()`, so file events were never written to the session DB
- Zombie session vacuum warnings on startup
- `_init_and_call` test helper now surfaces actual MCP error messages instead of crashing with `KeyError`
- Snapshot test pool exhaustion -- autouse cleanup fixture deletes manual snapshots after each test

### Removed
- Guest `capsem-fs-watch` inotify daemon and vsock port 5005 -- host-side FSEvents monitoring fully replaces guest-side file watching

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **VirtioFS storage mode** -- replaces tmpfs overlay + scratch disk with a single VirtioFS shared directory per session. Enables host-side file monitoring, auto-snapshots, and MCP file tools. System packages use an ext4 loopback image; workspace files in `/root` are directly visible on the host.
- **Host-side file monitoring** -- macOS FSEvents watches the VirtioFS workspace directory, replacing the in-guest `capsem-fs-watch` inotify daemon. More secure (no guest cooperation needed).
- **Rolling auto-snapshots** -- 12 APFS clone snapshots at 5-minute intervals (configurable). AI agents can list changed files and revert individual files to any checkpoint via MCP tools.
- **MCP file tools** -- `list_changed_files` (diff workspace against any auto-snapshot checkpoint) and `revert_file` (restore a file from any checkpoint, reflected immediately in guest via VirtioFS). Wired into the MCP gateway as built-in tools.
- **VirtioFS capsem-doctor tests** -- 9 new in-VM tests verifying VirtioFS root mount, ext4 loopback upper, loop device, workspace read/write, pip install, file delete+recreate
- Kernel support for VirtioFS (`CONFIG_FUSE_FS`, `CONFIG_VIRTIO_FS`) and loop devices (`CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP`)
- Session schema v4: `storage_mode`, `rootfs_hash`, `rootfs_version` columns for rootfs lineage tracking
- Code coverage reporting via Codecov on PR and release CI pipelines
- OAuth credential forwarding for Claude Code and Gemini CLI -- auto-detects `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (subscription auth) and `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` (Google Cloud ADC), injects into guest VM at boot so agents work without API keys
- ECDSA SSH key detection (`id_ecdsa.pub`) in addition to ed25519 and RSA
- Boot screen with embedded release notes, download/boot progress, and re-run wizard button -- replaces the bare download progress overlay

### Changed
- Anthropic and OpenAI providers now enabled by default (was disabled) -- all three AI providers are allowed out of the box; corporate lockdown via `corp.toml` still overrides
- Default storage mode is now VirtioFS (block mode preserved for backward compatibility)
- Guest `capsem-fs-watch` daemon no longer launched in VirtioFS mode (host monitors instead)

### Fixed
- Frontend dependencies now auto-install on fresh clone -- `just dev`, `just ui`, `just run`, `just test`, `just doctor`, and all other recipes that need npm packages run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` automatically
- Setup wizard re-run now re-detects host configuration (SSH keys, API keys, OAuth credentials, GitHub tokens) instead of keeping stale values from first run

## [0.9.18] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- MCP server and filesystem watcher missing from release VM assets -- Claude and Gemini reported MCP as "disconnected" because `capsem-mcp-server` and `capsem-fs-watch` were never included in the release rootfs
- MCP Servers settings page showing "no VM running" permanently -- MCP data now reloads automatically when the VM finishes booting

### Added
- Build pipeline now auto-derives guest binary list from `capsem-agent/Cargo.toml` -- adding a new `[[bin]]` target is automatically picked up by `build.py`
- Rust test and preflight check verify all guest binaries appear in `Dockerfile.rootfs` and `justfile` -- prevents future binary-list drift between dev and release

## [0.9.17] - 2026-03-20

## [0.9.16] - 2026-03-20

## [0.9.15] - 2026-03-20

## [0.9.14] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Download progress screen not shown on first launch: `vmStatus()` poll now returns "downloading" via app-level state, fixing the race where the event fired before the frontend subscribed
- `latest.json` missing from release artifacts, causing auto-updater `update check failed` on every boot

## [0.9.13] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- First-launch crash: `gui_boot_vm` called from tokio worker thread after rootfs download caused `EXC_BREAKPOINT` (`dispatch_assert_queue_fail`). VM start/stop now guarded by `is_main_thread()` check, post-download boot dispatched to main thread via `run_on_main_thread`
- Site domain references updated from `capsem.dev` (dead) to `capsem.org`

### Added
- Boot path logging: `resolve_rootfs` and `create_asset_manager` now log each location checked, version, manifest path, release count, and download status
- `cut-release` recipe: one-command version bump, changelog stamp, commit, tag, push, and CI wait

### Changed
- Release pipeline merged from two steps (build on tag push + publish via `workflow_dispatch`) into a single pipeline that builds and publishes on tag push
- `release` recipe simplified: waits for CI build (which now includes publish), no longer triggers a separate workflow
- Consolidated seven 0.9.x news posts into a single page covering 0.9.0 through 0.9.13

## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Wizard validates API keys in real-time against provider endpoints (spinner, check/X inline)
- API key detection now checks `~/.config/openai/api_key` and `~/.anthropic/api_key`
- Build verification documentation (SBOM and attestation)

### Fixed
- `svelte-check` failing on `dist/` build artifacts (excluded from tsconfig)

## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Download progress now shown in main app view when setup wizard is skipped (returning users with existing config but missing rootfs saw a blank terminal)

### Added
- Frontend test infrastructure (vitest + @testing-library/svelte) with store and component tests

## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Rootfs removed from DMG bundle (was 463 MB, now ~15 MB) -- rootfs is downloaded on first launch
- Build attestation (SBOM + provenance) restored after CI refactor
- Manifest metadata published with asset hashes and release attestations

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- CI codesign hang: keychain now set as default, explicitly unlocked with 1-hour timeout, and existing keychain search list preserved
- CI Node.js upgraded from 22 to 24
- CI release creation split from build: artifacts uploaded as CI artifacts, release created locally with `gh` CLI (org restricts GITHUB_TOKEN to read-only)

### Changed
- GitHub Actions upgraded to Node 24 (checkout v5, setup-node v5, upload/download-artifact v5, setup-buildx v4)
- CI workflow scoped to PRs only; site deploy scoped to main + web/marketing/ changes only

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Persistent logging system: three-layer tracing (stdout, per-launch JSONL file, Tauri UI layer) with per-VM log files in session directories (CLI + GUI)
- Logs view in sidebar with live event stream, boot timeline visualization, session history browser, level filtering, and auto-scroll
- Per-launch log files (`~/.capsem/logs/<timestamp>.jsonl`) with automatic 7-day cleanup
- Per-VM session logs (`~/.capsem/sessions/<id>/capsem.log`) with structured JSONL events for both CLI and GUI modes
- `load_session_log` and `list_log_sessions` Tauri commands for historical log access
- Error messages now included in `vm-state-changed` events for all error states
- Boot timeline state transitions emitted as structured tracing events
- Integration test verifies log file creation, JSONL validity, level filtering, boot timeline events, and timestamp format
- App auto-update: `createUpdaterArtifacts` enabled so CI produces `.tar.gz` + `.sig` updater files and `latest.json` -- the built-in updater now works
- `app.auto_update` setting (default: true) to gate the startup update check, with "Check for Updates" button in Settings > App
- Multi-version asset manifest (`manifest.json`) replaces single-version `B3SUMS` -- supports multiple release versions, merge across releases, and future checkpoint restore
- Version-scoped asset directories (`~/.capsem/assets/v{version}/`) with automatic migration from flat layout and cleanup of old versions
- `pinned.json` support for keeping specific asset versions during cleanup (for future checkpointing)
- `build_system/scripts/build/gen_manifest.py` for manifest generation in justfile and build.py
- First-run setup wizard -- 6-step guided configuration (Welcome, Security, AI Providers, Repositories, MCP Servers, All Set) that runs while the VM image downloads in the background
- Host config auto-detection -- wizard scans ~/.gitconfig, ~/.ssh/*.pub, environment variables, and `gh auth token` to pre-populate settings with detected values
- SSH public key setting (`vm.environment.ssh.public_key`) -- injected as /root/.ssh/authorized_keys in the guest VM at boot
- Re-run setup wizard button in Settings > VM to revisit configuration without overwriting existing settings
- Resumable asset downloads -- partial .tmp files are preserved across app restarts and continued via HTTP Range headers instead of re-downloading from scratch
- Security presets ("Medium" and "High") -- one-click security profiles selectable from Settings > Security
- Automatic migration of old setting IDs (`web.*`, `registry.*`) to new `security.*` namespace -- existing user.toml and corp.toml files work without manual changes
- `fetch_http` now supports `format=markdown` (new default) -- converts HTML to clean markdown preserving headings, links, lists, bold/italic, and code blocks
- Wikipedia (`en.wikipedia.org`, `*.wikipedia.org`) added to default allow list for MCP HTTP tools
- Auto-detect latest stable kernel version from kernel.org during `just build-assets`
- User-editable bashrc and tmux.conf as file settings in Settings > VM > Shell
- Filetype-aware syntax highlighting for file settings (bash, conf, json)
- Documentation URLs for API key settings (links to provider console/settings pages)
- Repositories section in settings with git identity (author name/email) for VM commits
- Personal access token settings for GitHub and GitLab (enables git push over HTTPS via .git-credentials)
- GitLab as a repository provider with domain allow/block and token support
- Added `tmux` and `gh` to the default rootfs for terminal multiplexing and GitHub CLI support
- Token prefix hints in settings UI -- apikey inputs show expected format (e.g., `ghp_...`, `sk-ant-...`) with a warning if the entered value doesn't match
- `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` env vars injected in VM when GitHub token is configured, enabling `gh` CLI without `gh auth login`
- `GITLAB_TOKEN` env var injected in VM when GitLab token is configured

### Changed
- CI release workflow now accumulates manifest.json across releases and uploads it alongside rootfs
- `_pack-initrd` regenerates manifest.json on every `just run` via `build_system/scripts/build/gen_manifest.py`
- `build.rs` reads hashes from manifest.json (preferred) with B3SUMS fallback
- Settings restructured: "Web" and "Package Registries" merged under new "Security" top-level section with "Web", "Services > Search Engines", and "Services > Package Registries" sub-groups
- MCP gateway rewritten to use rmcp (official Rust MCP SDK) -- replaces hand-rolled JSON-RPC/SSE client with proper Streamable HTTP transport, automatic pagination, and typed tool/resource/prompt routing
- Upgraded reqwest from 0.12 to 0.13
- MCP server UI redesigned: collapsible server cards with URL/auth config, "verified"/"definition changed" status labels
- Tool origin telemetry expanded from 2 values (native/mcp) to 3 values (native/mcp_proxy/local)
- Auto-detected stdio MCP servers from Claude/Gemini settings shown with unsupported warning instead of silently dropped
- `just install` now runs validation gates only (doctor + full-test); `.app` bundling is CI-only
- Missing API key warnings now appear in the group header when collapsed, with a "Get key" link
- GitHub moved from "Package Registries" to "Repositories" section
- `registry.github.*` setting IDs renamed to `repository.github.*`
- Package Registries description updated to "Package manager registries"

### Removed
- Stdio bridge for MCP servers (`stdio_bridge.rs`) -- replaced by HTTP client

### Fixed
- MCP server bearer token auth sent double "Bearer" prefix (`Bearer Bearer <token>`), causing 401 from authenticated servers like deps.dev
- Tool calls no longer double-counted in stats -- MCP-proxied tool_calls (origin=mcp_proxy) filtered from native counts across all 6 tool queries
- Native tool response preview now displayed in unified tool list (was hardcoded NULL, now joined from tool_responses via call_id)
- Non-text content blocks (tool_reference, image) in Anthropic tool results now produce meaningful preview instead of empty string
- OpenAI multipart tool result content now extracted correctly
- `check_session.py` tool response matching fixed -- joins on call_id only (tool responses arrive in next model call with different model_call_id)
- MCP server now visible in `claude mcp list` -- was injected into wrong file (`settings.json` instead of `.claude.json`)
- Codex CLI MCP server config added (`~/.codex/config.toml`) -- was missing entirely
- Disabling an AI provider now takes effect immediately on existing keep-alive connections (policy was previously snapshot per-connection, not per-request, so in-flight HTTP/1.1 connections continued to allow requests after the provider was toggled off)
- MCP tool_responses no longer double-counted in multi-turn conversations (request parsers now extract only trailing tool results instead of full history)
- MCP call previews no longer truncated at 200 chars (removed hard truncation; 256KB cap_field safety net remains)
- `fetch_http` paginate now UTF-8 safe -- uses `floor_char_boundary` to avoid panics on multi-byte content (emoji, Cyrillic, CJK, etc.)
- `fetch_http` on subpaths (e.g. `elie.net/about`) now returns full page content -- replaced `tl` HTML parser with `scraper` (html5ever) which correctly handles minified/complex HTML
- `fetch_http` format default changed from `content` to `markdown` for better AI agent consumption
- MCP byte tracking: `bytes_sent`/`bytes_received` columns added to mcp_calls for full I/O auditability
- Builtin MCP tool HTTP requests now emit net_events with `conn_type=mcp_builtin` for network audit visibility
- Guest process_name resolution uses `/proc/{pid}/cmdline` (real binary name) instead of `/proc/{pid}/comm` (thread name), fixing "MainThread" attribution
- Gemini tool call_ids now include a counter suffix to distinguish multiple calls to the same function
- Claude Code no longer warns about missing `/root/.local/bin` directory (created at boot after scratch disk mount)
- tmux now has a clean minimal config: mouse support, no escape delay, proper 256-color/truecolor, high scrollback
- tmux sessions can now find `gemini` and other npm-global binaries (PATH was lost when tmux started a login shell that reset it via `/etc/profile`)
- `gh auth status` injection test no longer fails with fake test tokens (test now verifies token detection, not authentication)
- Git authentication in VM: switched from `.netrc` to `.git-credentials` + `credential.helper=store` so `git push` works out of the box
- "Get one" links in settings now open in host browser via `tauri-plugin-opener` (previously broken in Tauri webview)

### Security
- Kernel hardening: heap zeroing (`INIT_ON_ALLOC`), SLUB freelist hardening, page allocator randomization, KPTI (`UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0`), ARM64 BTI + PAC, `HARDENED_USERCOPY`, seccomp filter, cmdline hardening (`init_on_alloc=1 slab_nomerge page_alloc.shuffle=1`)
- Git credential tokens now reject `@` and `:` characters (in addition to newlines) to prevent URL injection in `.git-credentials`

## [0.8.8] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Proxy throughput benchmark (`capsem-bench throughput`): downloads 100 MB through the full MITM proxy pipeline and reports MB/s — baseline ~35 MB/s on Apple Silicon
- `capsem-bench` is now repacked into the initrd on every `just run`, so changes to the benchmark script take effect immediately without a full rootfs rebuild
- `ash-speed.hetzner.com` added to the default network allow list and integration test config for the throughput benchmark
- Rust integration test `mitm_proxy_download_throughput` (in `crates/capsem-core/tests/mitm_integration.rs`): validates 100 MB download through the proxy at the host level; marked `#[ignore]` so it runs only on demand
- `test_proxy_download_throughput` in `capsem-doctor` (`test_network.py`): in-VM Layer 7 test verifying end-to-end proxy throughput; skips gracefully if the speed-test domain is not in the allow list
- `web/docs/performance.md`: documents all benchmark modes, baseline numbers, proxy data path, and domain allow list setup
- `just run` now kills any existing Capsem instance before booting, preventing a stale GUI window from appearing alongside a CLI run
- Notarization credential verification in CI preflight job: validates Apple API key against `notarytool history` before spending time on build-assets and tests
- Notarization preflight check in `build_system/scripts/bootstrap/preflight.sh`: verifies `.p8` key, API Key ID, Issuer ID, and runs a live `notarytool history` test

### Fixed
- `capsem-init` now aborts boot (kernel panic) if the tmpfs mount for the overlay upper layer fails, preventing a silent degraded boot where writes land on the initramfs instead of the intended tmpfs
- `capsem-init` now creates `/mnt/b` before mounting tmpfs on it (missing `mkdir -p` caused the tmpfs mount to fail with "No such file or directory" on fresh initrds)
- CI release no longer hangs on first-time notarization: `--skip-stapling` flag submits for notarization without waiting for Apple's response (first-time notarization can take hours)

### Security
- Boot invariant enforcement: `capsem-init` fatal-exits on tmpfs or overlayfs mount failure rather than continuing with a wrong upper layer; preflight check verifies this abort is present

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- `apt-get install` support inside the VM: overlayfs mounts with `redirect_dir=on,metacopy=on` (requires `CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_REDIRECT_DIR`, `CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_INDEX`, `CONFIG_TMPFS_XATTR` in kernel config), enabling dpkg directory renames without EXDEV errors. Packages installed in a session are gone after shutdown (ephemeral model preserved).
- `apt-packages.txt`: declarative list of system packages baked into the rootfs — edit and `just build-assets` to add/remove packages.
- Debian apt sources switched to HTTPS (`deb.debian.org`, `security.debian.org`) in `Dockerfile.rootfs`; both domains added to the default network allow list so the MITM proxy forwards them.
- Package lists pre-populated at rootfs build time so `apt-get install` works inside a running VM without a prior `apt-get update`.
- `force-unsafe-io` dpkg config in `capsem-init`: skips redundant fsyncs on overlayfs.
- Claude Code installed as a native binary (downloaded directly from Anthropic's GCS release bucket) instead of via npm, removing the Node.js dependency for the Claude CLI.
- Ephemeral model preflight check (`check_ephemeral_model` in `build_system/scripts/bootstrap/preflight.sh`): statically verifies `capsem-init` never skips `mke2fs` and never uses the scratch disk as overlay upper layer.
- Ephemeral model end-to-end test (`check_persistence` in `build_system/scripts/test/integration_test.py`): boots two consecutive VMs, writes a sentinel file in the first, and asserts it is absent in the second.

### Changed
- `images/README.md` developer section now documents how to add packages from all sources (apt, pip, npm, runtime) with copy-paste examples.

### Security
- Ephemeral model invariants documented in `CLAUDE.md` and enforced by preflight + integration test to prevent accidental persistence anti-patterns from being introduced.

### Added
- `just doctor` command: checks all required dev tools, container runtime (docker/podman), Rust targets, and cargo tools are installed
- Release preflight checks (`build_system/scripts/bootstrap/preflight.sh`): validates Apple certificate format, keychain import, and base64 sync before CI release
- `build_system/packaging/macos/fix_p12_legacy.sh`: converts OpenSSL 3.x p12 files to legacy 3DES format macOS Keychain accepts
- CI preflight job in release workflow: fails fast on certificate/credential issues before slow build jobs

### Changed
- Release builds are CI-only (removed `just release`); push a `vX.Y.Z` tag to trigger `.github/workflows/release.yaml`
- `just build-assets`, `just install` now run `just doctor` first to catch missing tools early
- `just run`, `just full-test`, `just bench` now verify VM assets exist before proceeding

### Fixed
- Apple certificate import in CI: re-exported p12 with legacy 3DES/SHA1 encryption (macOS rejects OpenSSL 3.x default PBES2/AES-256-CBC with misleading "wrong password" error)

### Added
- Configuration overrides via `CAPSEM_USER_CONFIG` and `CAPSEM_CORP_CONFIG` environment variables to support isolated testing and CI.
- Dedicated integration test configurations (`config/integration-test-user.toml` and `config/integration-test-corp.toml`) for reproducible end-to-end validation.
- Thin DMG distribution: rootfs excluded from app bundle, downloaded on first launch via asset manager with blake3 hash verification
- Asset manager (`asset_manager.rs`): checks, downloads, and verifies VM assets from GitHub Releases with streaming progress
- Download progress UI: full-screen progress bar shown during first-launch rootfs download
- CLI download support: `capsem "command"` auto-downloads rootfs with stderr progress if missing
- Squashfs support: boot_vm accepts both rootfs.squashfs (new) and rootfs.img (legacy) formats
- Release workflow uploads rootfs.squashfs as separate GitHub Release asset alongside the thin DMG
- Onboarding plan (`web/docs/onboarding.md`): first-launch wizard scope for credentials, MCP config, and guided setup
- AI stats tab: unified model analytics with stat cards (total calls, tokens, cost, models), model usage chart, token breakdown, cost-over-time, and provider distribution
- `StatCards.svelte` reusable component for stat card rows across all analytics tabs
- Chart color system (`css-var.ts`): provider hue families, model color assignment, file action colors, server palette -- all using oklch() constants (no CSS var lookups)
- LayerChart v2 API documentation (`web/docs/libs/layercharts.md`) for LLM-friendly chart development

### Changed
- Asset resolution in macOS app bundle now searches multiple paths in `Resources` (including nested Tauri v2 paths) for better reliability.
- Integration test isolated from host user settings and correctly maps `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `GEMINI_API_KEY` for the internal VM CLI.
- Tauri asset bundling now uses a flat map to prevent deeply nested `_up_/_up_/assets` structures in the final package.
- `just dev` now automatically passes `CAPSEM_ASSETS_DIR` to ensure the VM boots during local development.
- Stats "Models" tab renamed to "Model" (AITab.svelte replaces ModelsTab.svelte)
- Network, Tools, and Files stats tabs rebuilt with LayerChart v2 simplified chart components (BarChart, PieChart) replacing raw D3/Chart.js primitives
- SQL queries expanded: per-model token/cost breakdowns, provider distribution, cost-over-time, tool success rates, file action breakdowns
- Wizard auto-show on first run removed (setup wizard is still accessible from sidebar)

### Fixed
- Integration test SQLite connection robustness improved by using plain paths instead of URI formatting.
- Anthropic API tracking: MITM proxy now strips `accept-encoding` for AI providers so SSE streaming responses arrive uncompressed. This fixes the issue where Anthropic usage and cost were recorded as NULL.
- AI telemetry pollution: `model_call` records are now strictly filtered to valid LLM API paths (e.g., `/v1/messages`), preventing metadata endpoints from generating spurious NULL traces.
- Fallback model extraction: Added regex-based fallback to extract the model name from truncated JSON request bodies when the 64KB preview buffer limit is reached.
- fs-watch telemetry drops: Fixed a race condition during VM boot where early vsock connections (like `fs-watch`) were dropped by the host before the terminal/control handshake completed.
- `build_system/packaging/macos/run_signed.sh` now correctly refreshes the binary signature via `touch` after re-signing with entitlements.
- Build prerequisites documentation updated with `b3sum`, `tauri-cli`, and `musl-cross` toolchain requirements.
- capsem-doctor PATH: writable bin dirs (`/root/.npm-global/bin`, `/root/.local/bin`) now included so AI CLIs and npm globals are found
- Gemini CLI settings.json: added `homeDirectoryWarningDismissed` and `sessionRetention` to suppress first-run prompts
- AI provider domain-blocked test now skips when the provider is explicitly enabled by policy
- Integration test handles compressed session DBs (`session.db.gz`) after vacuum
- Integration test accepts `vacuumed` as valid terminal session status

### Changed
- capsem-doctor and diagnostics are now repacked into the initrd, so changes take effect with `just run` instead of requiring `just build-assets`
- `just full-test` now includes initrd repack to ensure latest guest code is deployed

### Added
- `config_lint()` function: validates all settings (JSON files, number ranges, choices, API key format, nul bytes, URL format) with clear human-readable error messages displayed inline in the settings UI
- `SettingsNode` tree API: backend exposes the TOML settings hierarchy as a nested tree with resolved values at leaves, replacing the flat list for UI rendering
- `get_settings_tree` and `lint_config` Tauri commands for the new tree-based settings UI
- UI debug skill (`.claude/skills/UI_debug.md`): comprehensive Chrome DevTools MCP-based visual verification checklist for the settings UI

### Changed
- File settings now store path and content together as `{ path, content }` objects instead of keeping `guest_path` in metadata -- path is the source of truth for MCP injection and guest config generation
- Guest config file permissions tightened from 0o644 to 0o600 (owner-only) since settings files may contain API keys
- JSON validation uses zero-allocation `serde::de::IgnoredAny` instead of parsing into `serde_json::Value`
- Settings UI fully rewritten: left nav and section content are auto-generated from the TOML settings tree. Adding new categories or settings to `defaults.toml` automatically appears in the UI with no frontend code changes. Replaced 6 hardcoded section components (ProvidersSection, McpSection, NetworkPolicySection, EnvironmentSection, ResourcesSection, AppearanceSection) and their icon imports with a single generic recursive renderer (`SettingsSection.svelte`)
- SubMenu component now supports optional icons (icon-less items render label only)

### Security
- File setting paths are validated: must start with `/`, must not contain `..`, warns on unusual paths not under `/root/` or `/etc/`

### Added
- File analytics section: stat cards, action breakdown chart, events-over-time chart, and searchable event table for filesystem activity tracking
- Setup wizard hook: auto-detects first run (no API keys configured) and shows a welcome view with provider setup shortcut
- Reveal/hide toggle for API key and password fields in provider settings
- Range hints (min/max) shown below number inputs in VM resource and appearance settings
- Dropdown rendering for settings with predefined choices

### Changed
- Analytics data separation: Models and MCP analytics sections now exclusively query session.db; cross-session data (sessions over time, avg calls per session) moved to Dashboard
- "Session stats" button in terminal footer now navigates to session-level AI analytics instead of cross-session dashboard
- MCP analytics stat cards expanded from 2 (total + avg/session) to 4 (total, allowed, warned, denied)

### Security
- main.db `query_raw` now enforces `PRAGMA query_only = ON` around user SQL execution, preventing write-through via SQL injection (e.g., `SELECT 1; DROP TABLE sessions`) in the `query_db` IPC command
- Read-only enforcement tests for both session.db (`DbReader`) and main.db (`SessionIndex`) query paths: INSERT, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, and semicolon injection all verified to fail at the SQLite level

### Changed
- Unified SQL gateway: `query_db` IPC command now supports both session.db and main.db via `db` parameter ("session" or "main"), with bind parameter support via `params` array. Replaced 11 per-query Tauri commands (net_events, get_model_calls, get_traces, get_trace_detail, get_mcp_calls, get_file_events, get_session_history, get_global_stats, get_top_providers, get_top_tools, get_top_mcp_tools) with a single `query_db` gateway
- Frontend queries now run through `db.ts` (unified query layer) instead of individual api.ts wrappers, using parameterized SQL from `sql.ts`
- Removed `ModelCallResponse` Rust wrapper struct (was only needed for the deleted `get_model_calls` command)
- Justfile streamlined from 23 recipes to 13 public + 5 internal helpers: `run` now auto-repacks initrd (replaces separate `repack`), `test` includes cross-compile + frontend check (replaces `check`), `full-test` combines capsem-doctor + integration test + bench (replaces `smoke-test`/`integration-test`/`preflight`), `build-assets` replaces `build`, `inspect-session` replaces `check-session`, `release` now produces a DMG at `target/release/Capsem.dmg`
- Removed recipes: `compile`, `sign`, `frontend`, `rebuild`, `repack`, `repack-initrd`, `ensure-tools`, `smoke-test`, `integration-test`, `preflight` (functionality preserved as internal `_`-prefixed helpers or merged into public recipes)

### Fixed
- 12 compilation warnings eliminated across 3 files: dead code warnings in `capsem-fs-watch` cross-platform helpers (blanket `#![cfg_attr(not(target_os = "linux"), allow(dead_code))]`), unused `SessionStats` import in commands.rs, and test-only `close()` method gated with `#[cfg(test)]`
- Test fixture updated from integration test session with full pipeline coverage: denied net events, deleted file events, positive cost estimates, `origin` column on tool_calls
- `fixture_top_domains_non_empty` test assertion fixed: `count >= allowed + denied` accounts for error events that are counted in total but not in allowed/denied buckets
- `query_raw_real_type` test now validates REAL type serialization without requiring positive cost values in the fixture
- Integration test now exercises denied net events (curl to blocked domain), deleted file events (create + rm), cost estimation assertions, and tool origin verification (34 checks, up from 28)

### Added
- Session DB lifecycle management: sessions now progress through running -> stopped -> vacuumed -> terminated states. After a session stops, its DB is checkpointed, vacuumed, and gzip-compressed (`session.db.gz`), then WAL/SHM files are removed. Terminated sessions retain their main.db audit trail record even after disk artifacts are deleted.
- `vm.terminated_retention_days` setting (default 365): controls how long terminated session records are kept in main.db before permanent purging
- Periodic main.db WAL checkpoint every 5 minutes to prevent unbounded WAL growth
- DbWriter now checkpoints WAL on clean shutdown (drop)
- Startup vacuum recovery: any sessions that stopped but were not vacuumed (e.g. due to crash) are automatically compressed on next app launch
- `check-session` script now handles compressed session DBs (auto-decompresses `.gz` files)
- End-to-end integration test (`just integration-test`): boots a real VM, exercises all 6 telemetry pipelines (fs_events, net_events, mcp_calls, model_calls, tool_calls, main.db rollup), runs capsem-doctor MCP tests, asks Gemini to write a poem, and verifies every event type is correctly logged in the session DB
- Release preflight gates (`just preflight`): unit tests, cross-compile, capsem-doctor smoke test, integration test, and benchmarks must all pass before `just release` or `just install` builds the app
- In-VM benchmark recipe (`just bench`): standalone entry point for capsem-bench (disk I/O, rootfs read, CLI startup, HTTP latency)
- Tool origin tracking: `tool_calls` table now records `origin` ("native" or "mcp") and `mcp_call_id` columns to distinguish model built-in tools from MCP gateway tools
- `check-session` data quality warnings: flags model_calls with NULL model, tokens, or request_body_preview
- `check-session` tool lifecycle section: shows origin breakdown and MCP call correlation
- Diagnostic logging when streaming model_calls complete with NULL model, tokens, or preview fields

### Fixed
- Session backfill now looks for `session.db` instead of the old `info.db` filename
- MITM proxy AI telemetry: model name, token counts, and request body preview were NULL for all model_calls when `log_bodies` was disabled. The proxy now always captures up to 64KB of AI provider request/response bodies for metadata parsing regardless of the `log_bodies` setting.
- MITM proxy model resolution: added fallback chain (request body -> SSE stream -> response JSON -> URL path) so model name is extracted even for providers that put it in the URL (e.g. Gemini `/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent`)
- MITM proxy stream detection: streaming flag now detected from URL path (`streamGenerateContent` vs `generateContent`) instead of unreliable request body parsing
- MITM proxy non-streaming usage: token counts now parsed from JSON response body when SSE stream parsing yields no usage metadata
- MITM proxy tool origin: tool_calls now use `tool_origin()` for correct "native" vs "mcp" classification instead of hardcoding "native"
- MITM proxy tool responses: tool_result entries from AI request bodies are now correctly extracted (previously always empty when body capture was disabled)
- MITM proxy non-streaming response parsing now handles gzip-compressed response bodies (upstream often sends Content-Encoding: gzip)
- MITM proxy no longer creates model_call records for HEAD requests (connectivity probes from AI CLIs have no body/model/tokens)
- Telemetry event pipeline silently dropping events under burst load: `try_write()` in MITM proxy and fs-watch handler failed without logging when the 256-slot DB channel was full (e.g. during `npm install`). Replaced with async `write().await` via `tokio::spawn` for backpressure, and bumped channel capacity from 256 to 4096.
- MCP builtin tools (`fetch_http`, `grep_http`, `http_headers`) returning empty responses: `capsem-mcp-server` used `SHUT_RDWR` after stdin closed, killing in-flight gateway responses before they could be read back. Changed to `SHUT_WR` (half-close) so the reader thread collects all responses before shutdown.
- MCP `fetch_http` and `grep_http` now reject binary content (images, PDFs, audio, video, etc.) with a clear error instead of returning garbled text or UTF-8 decode errors
- MCP tools now reject non-HTTP schemes (`file://`, `ftp://`, `data:`, etc.) before any network request is made
- MCP `grep_http` now rejects empty patterns instead of matching every line

### Changed
- Settings registry migrated from hardcoded Rust to `config/defaults.toml` (TOML-based, embedded at compile time). Setting definitions use `String` fields instead of `&'static str`. No user-facing behavior change.
- Session culling now marks sessions as "terminated" instead of deleting main.db rows, preserving the audit trail. Old terminated records are purged after `vm.terminated_retention_days` (default 365 days).
- Schema migrated from v2 to v3 (additive: new `compressed_size_bytes` and `vacuumed_at` columns on sessions table)
- MCP built-in tools exposed without `builtin__` prefix: models now see `fetch_http`, `grep_http`, `http_headers` instead of `builtin__fetch_http` etc. -- cleaner tool names for AI agents
- MCP built-in tool descriptions rewritten with full documentation: HTML extraction behavior, output format, pagination, domain policy enforcement, and error conditions
- Per-session analytics (Traffic, AI Models, MCP views) now use `queryDb(sql)` with SQL constants instead of dedicated Tauri commands -- reduces Rust boilerplate and gives the frontend more flexibility
- Network store rewritten: individual SQL queries replace monolithic `getSessionStats()` call, adding SQL-driven avg latency, method distribution, and process distribution
- Dashboard session detail no longer shows file event count (global dashboard should only show global data)
- Rootfs switched from 2GB ext4 to 382MB squashfs (zstd, 64K blocks) -- 81% smaller for DMG distribution
- Boot sequence uses overlayfs (immutable squashfs lower + ephemeral tmpfs upper) -- writes to system paths silently go to tmpfs
- Test fixture (`data/fixtures/test.db`) is now captured from real sessions instead of generated by a Python script
- `just update-fixture <path>` replaces `just gen-test-db`: copies a real session DB, scrubs API keys, and syncs to `web/app/public/fixtures/`

### Removed
- Dead AI gateway server (`gateway/server.rs`, 997 lines): axum HTTP server on vsock:5004 was never wired up in main.rs. All AI traffic goes through the MITM proxy on vsock:5002. `extract_model_from_path`, `parse_non_streaming_usage`, and `tool_origin` helpers moved to `gateway/provider.rs` and `gateway/events.rs` where the MITM proxy can use them.
- `VSOCK_PORT_AI_GATEWAY` constant (port 5004) -- unused, never wired up
- `GatewayConfig` struct -- only used by the dead server
- `gateway_integration.rs` test file -- tests for the dead server
- `axum` dependency from capsem-core
- `get_session_stats`, `get_mcp_stats`, `get_file_stats` Tauri IPC commands -- replaced by frontend SQL via `queryDb()`
- `SessionStatsResponse` struct from commands.rs and `SessionStatsResponse`, `SessionStats`, `McpCallStats`, `FileEventStats` types from frontend
- `SessionsSection.svelte` -- orphan component never imported by AnalyticsView
- `data/fixtures/generate_test_db.py` -- synthetic data generator replaced by real session captures

### Added
- `sql.ts`: centralized SQL query constants for all per-session analytics (13 queries covering net stats, domains, time buckets, provider usage, tool usage, model stats, MCP stats, file stats, latency, method/process distribution)
- `queryOne<T>()` and `queryAll<T>()` typed helpers in `api.ts` for running SQL against the active session's info.db
- Analytics data architecture documented in `web/docs/architecture.md` (two-database design, data flow, query strategy, polling patterns)
- Frontend development skill file (`.claude/skills/frontend.md`)
- In-VM filesystem watcher (`capsem-fs-watch`): inotify-based daemon streams file create/modify/delete events to the host over vsock:5005 for real-time file activity telemetry
- `fs_events` audit table in `capsem-logger`: records every file operation with timestamp, action, path, and size
- `FileEvent` type with `WriteOp::FileEvent` variant and reader queries (`recent_file_events`, `search_file_events`, `file_event_stats`)
- `get_file_events` and `get_file_stats` Tauri IPC commands for the frontend
- Files view in frontend: summary cards (total/created/modified/deleted), searchable event table with action badges, 2s polling
- Files sidebar navigation item with document icon between Sessions and MCP Tools
- Mock file event data (13 entries) for browser dev mode
- MCP gateway wired to vsock:5003: host now accepts MCP connections from guest agents, fixing Gemini CLI hang on startup
- Built-in HTTP tools: `fetch_http`, `grep_http`, `http_headers` -- AI agents can fetch web content, search pages, and inspect headers from within the sandbox, all checked against domain policy
- MCP domain policy hot-reload: changing network settings in the UI immediately updates which domains built-in HTTP tools can access
- `capsem-doctor` MCP tests: 6 new in-VM diagnostic tests verifying MCP binary, initialize handshake, tools/list, allowed/blocked fetch, and fastmcp availability
- `fastmcp` Python package in guest rootfs for building custom MCP servers inside the VM
- MCP Proxy Gateway: AI agents in the guest VM can now use host-side MCP tools transparently via a unified `capsem-mcp-server` binary injected at boot
- `capsem-mcp-server` guest binary: lightweight NDJSON-over-vsock bridge (~90 lines) relaying MCP JSON-RPC between agents and the host gateway on vsock:5003
- MCP gateway host module (`capsem-core::mcp`): types, policy engine, stdio bridge, server manager, and vsock gateway for routing tool calls to host-side MCP servers
- Namespaced MCP tools: tools from multiple servers are exposed as `{server}__{tool}` to prevent collisions (e.g., `github__search_repos`, `slack__send_message`)
- Per-tool dynamic policy: each MCP tool can be set to allow (forward normally), warn (forward + flag), or block (return JSON-RPC error) with hot-reload via `Arc<RwLock<Arc<McpPolicy>>>`
- MCP server auto-detection: reads existing MCP configs from `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.gemini/settings.json` at boot
- `mcp_calls` audit table in `capsem-logger`: full telemetry for every MCP tool call (server, method, tool, decision, duration, error)
- `McpCall` event type with `WriteOp::McpCall` variant and `insert_mcp_call()` writer method
- `DbReader` MCP queries: `recent_mcp_calls(limit, search)` with text search across server/method/tool, `mcp_call_stats()` aggregation (total, allowed, denied, warned, by-server breakdown)
- Schema migration: existing databases automatically gain the `mcp_calls` table on open
- `get_mcp_calls` and `get_mcp_stats` Tauri IPC commands for the frontend
- `inject_capsem_mcp_server()`: automatically merges `{"capsem": {"command": "/run/capsem-mcp-server"}}` into Claude and Gemini settings.json at boot, preserving user-provided MCP server entries
- MCP Tools view in frontend: summary cards (total/warned/denied), per-server breakdown, searchable call log table with decision badges
- MCP sidebar navigation item with layers icon between Sessions and Settings
- Mock MCP data: 6 sample calls across 3 servers (github, filesystem, slack) for browser dev mode
- Generic usage details tracking: token breakdowns (cache_read, thinking) stored as extensible `usage_details` JSON map instead of individual columns -- zero schema changes when adding new token types
- OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`) streaming support: parses `response.created`, `response.output_text.delta`, `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, `response.output_item.added/done`, and `response.completed` SSE events
- OpenAI cached token parsing from `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` and reasoning token parsing from `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`
- Gemini thinking token parsing from `thoughtsTokenCount` (was parsed but unused)
- Non-streaming response parsing: gateway now extracts model, input/output tokens, and usage details from non-streaming JSON responses (all three providers), enabling cost estimation and token tracking for non-streamed API calls
- Cache and thinking token counts shown in session stats and trace detail UI

### Changed
- `capsem-proto` simplified: removed `McpGuestMsg`/`McpHostMsg` enums and encode/decode functions in favor of raw NDJSON passthrough (less code, better performance)
- `capsem-init` deploys `capsem-mcp-server` from initrd (with rootfs fallback)
- `just repack` cross-compiles and bundles `capsem-mcp-server` alongside pty-agent and net-proxy
- Sessions view: trace detail panel now shows MCP tool calls inline with model calls
- Token details stored as flexible `usage_details TEXT` JSON column replacing individual token columns -- single schema handles all current and future token breakdowns
- Cost estimation accounts for cached tokens: `cache_read` tokens subtracted from effective input before pricing calculation
- Pricing function signature simplified: accepts `&BTreeMap<String, u64>` usage details map instead of individual token parameters

### Fixed
- MCP gateway no longer sends a JSON-RPC response for `notifications/initialized` (it's a notification, not a request) -- fixes protocol confusion in some MCP clients
- Token metrics double-counted in trace detail view when a model call had both request and response tool entries -- now only the first row per call shows metrics
- Non-streaming API responses (no `stream: true`) recorded with null tokens and $0.00 cost -- now properly parsed for all providers
- HEAD connectivity checks from AI CLIs (Claude, Gemini) no longer create empty model_call rows -- filtered at the gateway level

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- `capsem-logger` crate: unified audit database with dedicated writer thread, replacing three separate SQLite databases (`WebDb`, `GatewayDb`, `AiDb`) with a single `session.db` per VM session
- Dedicated writer thread using `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel with block-then-drain batching (up to 128 ops per transaction), eliminating `spawn_blocking` + `Arc<Mutex<>>` contention
- `DbWriter` / `DbReader` API: async writes via channel, read-only WAL concurrent readers, typed `WriteOp` enum for debuggable operations
- Unified schema: `net_events` (all HTTPS connections), `model_calls` (denormalized request+response), `tool_calls`, `tool_responses` tables in a single DB file
- Inline SSE event parsing in the MITM proxy for AI provider traffic (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini)
- Provider-agnostic LLM event types (`LlmEvent`, `StreamSummary`) with `collect_summary()` for structured audit logging
- Hand-rolled SSE wire-format parser with chunk-boundary-safe state machine (no crate dependency)
- Provider-specific SSE stream parsers: Anthropic (interleaved content blocks, thinking), OpenAI Chat Completions (tool calls, content filter), Google Gemini (complete events, synthetic call IDs)
- Request body parser extracting model, stream flag, system prompt preview, message/tool counts, and tool_result entries for tool call lifecycle linking
- `AiResponseBody`: hyper Body wrapper that does SSE parsing inline during `poll_frame` with zero added latency
- AI provider domain detection (`api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`, `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) in the MITM proxy
- API key suffix extraction (last 4 chars, Stripe-style) from `x-api-key` and `Authorization: Bearer` headers
- Per-call cost tracking: gateway estimates USD cost using bundled model pricing data from pydantic/genai-prices
- Fuzzy model name matching for pricing: unknown model variants (date-stamped, custom-suffixed) now resolve to the correct pricing via progressive suffix stripping and longest-prefix fallback instead of silently returning $0.00
- Trace ID assignment in MITM proxy: multi-turn tool-use conversations are linked by shared trace IDs, enabling the Sessions view to render conversation spans
- SQL-driven session statistics: counts, token usage, cost, domain distribution, and time-bucketed charts all computed via SQLite queries
- New Tauri IPC commands: `get_session_stats` (full aggregate dashboard data), `get_model_calls` (model call history with search)
- LLM Usage section in Sessions view: API call count, input/output tokens, estimated cost, per-provider breakdown, model calls table, tool usage badges
- SQL-powered search in Network view: debounced search queries hit SQLite LIKE instead of client-side filtering
- `just update_prices` recipe to refresh bundled model pricing data
- `capsem-bench` in-VM performance benchmark tool: disk I/O (sequential read/write, random 4K IOPS) and HTTP throughput (ab-style concurrent requests with latency percentiles)
- `capsem-bench rootfs` benchmark: sequential and random 4K read performance on the read-only rootfs
- `capsem-bench startup` benchmark: cold-start latency for python3, node, claude, gemini, and codex CLIs (3 runs, min/mean/max)
- Rich table formatting for all capsem-bench output (replaces manual text formatting)
- Configurable VM CPU cores via `vm.cpu_count` setting (1-8, default 4)
- Configurable VM RAM via `vm.ram_gb` setting (1-16 GB, default 4 GB)
- 1 GB swap file on scratch disk for better memory pressure handling
- Search category in settings: Google Search (on by default), Perplexity, and Firecrawl toggles with domain-level policy
- Custom allow/block domain lists (`network.custom_allow`, `network.custom_block`) for user-defined domain rules
- Active Policy debug panel in Network view: collapsible section showing allowed/blocked domain lists, default action, corp managed status, and policy conflicts
- Policy conflict detection: domains appearing in both allow and block lists are flagged in the Network view

### Changed
- Terminal UI overhaul: borderless look with 10px padding, thin styled scrollbar, theme-matching background (full black in dark mode)
- Removed bottom status bar; session stats (tokens, tools, cost, VM status) now displayed inline below the terminal
- Sidebar reorganized: Console + Sessions in nav, Settings/theme/collapse in footer
- Network view moved into Settings as a collapsible "Network Statistics" section
- Sessions panel (charts, spans, analytics) now accessible from sidebar nav
- Session Statistics section added to bottom of Settings view
- MITM proxy and gateway server use `DbWriter` channel instead of `spawn_blocking` + `Arc<Mutex<>>` for all database writes
- Session telemetry stored in `session.db` (was `info.db`)
- VM Disk Performance Overhaul: 2M+ IOPS for random 4K reads (~8 GB/s) and ~20x speedup in random write throughput
- Network Proxy Overhaul: replaced synchronous thread-per-connection guest proxy with Tokio-based async implementation
- Structural Latency Elimination: `TCP_NODELAY` on both guest and host proxies, reducing proxy overhead to the physical network floor (~40ms median RTT)
- VM CPU default increased from 2 to 4 cores
- VM RAM default increased from 512 MB to 4 GB
- Scratch disk default increased from 8 GB to 16 GB
- Node.js V8 heap cap raised from 512 MB to 2 GB to match higher RAM
- Network store is now SQL-driven: counts and charts read from `get_session_stats` instead of counting JS arrays
- Session info response expanded with LLM metrics (model call count, tokens, tool calls, estimated cost)
- `net_events` command accepts optional `search` parameter for SQL-backed filtering
- `get_session_info` is now async with `spawn_blocking` for proper non-blocking DB access
- Rootfs disk caching mode changed from `Automatic` to `Cached` for aggressive host page cache retention on the read-only disk
- Host-side disk settings: enabled host-level caching (`VZDiskImageCachingMode::Cached`) and disabled synchronization barriers (`VZDiskImageSynchronizationMode::None`)
- Guest-side kernel tuning: `capsem-init` now sets I/O scheduler to `none`, `read_ahead_kb` to 4096, and `nr_requests` to 256 for all VirtIO devices
- Filesystem optimizations: `noatime,nodiratime,noload` mount options for rootfs and scratch disks
- Scratch disk format optimization: `mke2fs -m 0` to reclaim reserved root blocks
- `elie.net` moved from a Package Registry toggle to the default custom allowed domains list
- `network.log_bodies` and `network.max_body_capture` moved from Network to VM category
- Session settings (`session.retention_days`, `session.max_sessions`, `session.max_disk_gb`) moved from Session to VM category
- Mock data now mirrors the full backend settings registry (~35 settings across 7 categories)
- Settings view categories displayed in fixed order: AI Providers, Search, Package Registries, Network, Guest Environment, Appearance, VM
- Settings view categories collapsed by default (click to expand)
- Network view: allowed/blocked domain lists are now separate collapsible groups within Active Policy

### Fixed
- VM status indicator now shows correct color (blue for running, yellow for booting) instead of defaulting to no color due to state casing mismatch between Rust and frontend
- MITM proxy now assigns trace IDs and estimates costs for AI model calls, enabling Sessions view to display LLM statistics
- Fixture-dependent test assertions in capsem-logger replaced with data-agnostic checks to prevent breakage on fixture regeneration
- Benign "error shutting down connection" warnings in the host proxy logs are now filtered

### Removed
- Dead `gateway/audit.rs` module (839 lines, never compiled) superseded by capsem-logger
- `GatewayDb` (redundant flat table, replaced by `model_calls` in unified schema)
- `AiDb` (normalized 4-table schema, merged into `capsem-logger`)
- `WebDb` (replaced by `net_events` table in unified schema)
- `StreamAccumulator` (unused since `AiResponseBody` replaced it)
- `registry.elie.allow` setting (replaced by `network.custom_allow` default)
- `registry.debian.allow` setting (rootfs is read-only, packages cannot be installed at runtime)
- `domainlist` setting type from frontend (custom allow/block use standard `text` type with ID-based chip rendering)

### Security
- Terminal input batching thread now caps coalesced buffer at 64 KB, preventing unbounded memory growth if the IPC channel is flooded faster than the inner try_recv loop can drain
- Sanitize HTTP headers in telemetry logs: allowlisted headers (content-type, host, server, etc.) stored verbatim; all others (authorization, x-api-key, cookies) have values replaced with BLAKE3 hash prefix (`hash:<12-char-hex>`) to prevent credential leakage while preserving header presence and enabling correlation

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- Terminal output uses poll-based binary IPC (`terminal_poll`) instead of JSON event emission, eliminating ~4x serialization overhead
- Terminal input batched with 5ms window (up to 4KB) to reduce IPC round-trips per keystroke
- Vsock read buffer increased from 8KB to 64KB and mpsc channel from 256 to 8192 entries
- CoalesceBuffer defaults changed from 10ms/64KB to 5ms/10MB for higher throughput
- Terminal output queue with 64-entry backpressure cap prevents OOM when frontend stops polling

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Guest dev environment: `pip install`, `uv pip install`, `npm install -g` all work out of the box on the read-only rootfs
- Python venv auto-activated at boot with `--system-site-packages` (packages install to `/root/.venv`)

- Claude Code yolo mode: `~/.claude/settings.json` with `bypassPermissions` + `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1`, and `~/.claude.json` state file to skip onboarding, trust dialogs, and keybinding prompts
- Gemini CLI yolo mode: `~/.gemini/settings.json` with `approvalMode: "yolo"`, telemetry/auto-updates disabled, folder trust disabled, and Gemini's own sandbox disabled (capsem provides the sandbox)
- Metadata-driven env var injection: settings declare `env_vars` in metadata instead of hardcoded mappings
- Built-in guest environment settings (`guest.shell.term`, `guest.shell.home`, `guest.shell.path`, `guest.shell.lang`, `guest.tls.ca_bundle`) configurable via user.toml and corp.toml
- Individual vsock boot messages (`SetEnv`, `FileWrite`, `BootConfigDone`) replacing single `BootConfig` frame, eliminating the 8KB frame size limit for boot configuration
- Guest boot log at `/var/log/capsem-boot.log` recording clock sync, env vars, file writes, and handshake status

- TypeScript IPC layer (`types.ts` + `api.ts`) with typed wrappers for all Tauri commands
- `svelte-check` added to `just check` and `pnpm run check` pipelines
- Generic typed settings system replacing TOML-based policy config -- each setting has ID, type, category, default, metadata, and optional `enabled_by` parent toggle
- Per-setting corp override: corporate settings (`/etc/capsem/corp.toml`) lock individual settings, not entire sections
- Setting metadata with domain patterns, HTTP method permissions, numeric bounds, and text choices
- `get_settings` and `update_setting` Tauri IPC commands for the settings UI
- Settings architecture documentation in `web/docs/architecture.md`

### Changed
- Increased vsock MAX_FRAME_SIZE from 8KB to 256KB for generous boot payloads
- Boot handshake protocol now sends env vars and files as individual messages instead of a single `BootConfig` payload
- Sessions view redesigned: current session info cards, network analytics, session history table (replaced CPU/memory/binary stats that VZ doesn't expose)
- Per-session telemetry renamed from `web.db` to `info.db` (legacy `web.db` still read for backward compatibility)
- Each VM boot creates a fresh telemetry database, eliminating stale request carryover between sessions
- Network policy replaced with simplified rule-based system: per-domain read/write verb control with defaults (GET allowed, POST denied)
- Configuration format changed from section-based TOML (`[network]`, `[guest]`, `[vm]`) to flat settings map (`[settings]` with dotted keys like `"registry.github.allow"`)
- Domain allow/block lists now derived from setting toggles and their metadata (e.g., toggling `registry.github.allow` controls `github.com`, `*.github.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com`)
- AI provider domains moved from explicit block-list to disabled-by-default toggles with domain metadata
- Guest environment variables stored as `guest.env.*` settings instead of `[guest].env` table
- VM settings (scratch disk size) stored as `vm.scratch_disk_size_gb` setting instead of `[vm]` section
- Removed SNI-based pre-TLS policy check; all policy enforcement at HTTP level
- Removed generativelanguage.googleapis.com from block-list (Gemini API testing)
- MITM proxy streams request and response bodies instead of buffering in memory
- Upstream TLS config cached per-VM instead of recreated per-request
- Default `log_bodies` changed from false to true

### Fixed
- Denied domains now record HTTP method, path, and status in telemetry (TLS handshake completes, denial at HTTP 403 level)
- Guest receives proper HTTP 403 response with reason for denied requests instead of cryptic TLS connection error
- "Invalid Date" in Session/Network views: timestamps now serialize as epoch seconds instead of SystemTime objects
- Legacy "default"/"cli" sessions migrated as "crashed" instead of carrying over stale "running" status
- web.db now records query string, matched rule, and 403 status for denied requests
- Upstream connection failures record error reason in telemetry

### Removed
- `get_vm_stats` command and `VmStats`/`BinaryCall` types (VZ framework doesn't expose guest metrics)
- Hardcoded `DEFAULT_VM_ID` constant -- replaced by dynamic session IDs
- `session.json` files -- replaced by `main.db` session index (migrated automatically)
- SNI parser module (`sni_parser.rs`) -- domain extracted from TLS handshake instead

### Security
- Env var sanitization: reject keys containing `=` or NUL bytes, values containing NUL (prevents agent crash / kernel panic)
- Blocked env var list: LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, IFS, BASH_ENV, and other dangerous variables rejected during boot
- Boot allocation caps: max 128 env vars, 64 files, 10MB total file data
- FileWrite path traversal protection: reject paths containing `..`
- Defense-in-depth: guest agent validates env vars and file paths independently of host
- Body size limit (100MB) prevents OOM from malicious guest payloads
- Replaced unsafe borrow_fd with safe fd cloning
- Corp-locked settings cannot be modified by user, enforced at the merge level

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Ephemeral scratch disk for `/root` workspace (8GB default, configurable via `[vm].scratch_disk_size_gb` in `~/.capsem/user.toml`)
- Per-session directory structure (`~/.capsem/sessions/<vm_id>/`) with session metadata (`session.json`)
- Stale session cleanup on startup: leftover scratch images deleted, orphaned "running" sessions marked as "crashed"
- Block device identifiers (`rootfs`, `scratch`) for stable device naming in the guest (`/dev/disk/by-id/virtio-*`)
- uv fast Python package installer available to guest AI agents

### Changed
- Guest `/root` workspace now uses ext4 on a virtio block device instead of RAM-backed tmpfs, increasing usable space from ~512MB to 8GB+
- Upgraded Node.js from Debian's v18 to v24 LTS via nvm
- Replaced pip3 with uv for in-VM Python package management (certifi, pytest)

### Fixed
- gemini CLI crashing with `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression flags` due to Node.js 18 lacking the 'v' regex flag
- AI CLI smoke test was too lenient -- now verifies `--help` runs without JS runtime errors instead of only checking for signal crashes

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Host-side state machine (`HostState`) with validated transitions, timing history, and structured perf logging
- Per-state message validation: host validates both outbound and inbound vsock control messages against lifecycle stage
- New Tauri IPC commands for Svelte UI: `get_guest_config`, `get_network_policy`, `set_guest_env`, `remove_guest_env`, `get_vm_state`
- Structured `vm-state-changed` events with JSON payloads (state + trigger) instead of plain strings
- Protocol documentation (`web/docs/protocol.md`): wire format, message reference, state machine diagrams, boot handshake, security invariants
- Zero-trust guest binary security rule documented in `web/docs/security.md`
- `write_policy_file()` for TOML serialization of user.toml changes from the UI
- MITM transparent proxy: full HTTP inspection (method, path, status code, headers, body preview) for all HTTPS traffic from the guest VM
- Static Capsem MITM CA certificate (ECDSA P-256, 100-year validity) baked into the guest rootfs trust store
- On-demand domain certificate minting with RwLock cache for TLS termination
- HTTP-level policy engine: method+path rules on top of domain allow/block lists (`[[network.rules]]` in user.toml)
- Extended telemetry: `web.db` now records HTTP method, path, status code, request/response headers, and body previews
- CA trust environment variables (`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`) injected via BootConfig
- certifi CA bundle patching in rootfs for Python SDK compatibility (requests, openai, anthropic)
- Schema migration for existing `web.db` databases (adds new columns without data loss)
- Clock synchronization -- guest VM clock is set from host at boot time (fixes TLS cert validation, git, curl)
- Environment variable injection via vsock boot config (`BootConfig`/`BootReady` handshake)
- `[guest]` section in `user.toml` for custom guest environment variables
- `--env KEY=VALUE` CLI flag for one-off env injection (`capsem --env FOO=bar echo $FOO`)
- `capsem-proto` crate -- shared protocol types for host/guest communication
- Clock sync diagnostic test in `capsem-doctor`
- In-VM diagnostic test suite expanded: MITM CA trust chain tests (system store, certifi, curl without -k, Python urllib), network edge cases (HTTP port 80, non-443 ports, direct IP, AI provider blocking, multi-domain DNS), process integrity (pty-agent, dnsmasq, no systemd/sshd/cron), deeper kernel hardening (no modules loaded, no debugfs, no IPv6, no swap, no kallsyms, ro cmdline), environment validation (TERM, HOME, PATH, arch, kernel version, mount points), and 14 additional unix utility checks
- `just test` recipe runs workspace tests with coverage summary via `cargo-llvm-cov`
- `just ensure-tools` auto-installs `cargo-llvm-cov` and `llvm-tools-preview` on fresh clones
- Air-gapped networking: `curl https://elie.net` now works from inside the guest VM
- Host-side SNI proxy inspects TLS ClientHello, enforces domain allow-list, and bridges to the real internet
- Domain policy engine with allow-list, block-list, and wildcard pattern matching (`*.github.com`)
- Configurable domain policy via `~/.capsem/user.toml` and `/etc/capsem/corp.toml` (corp overrides user)
- Per-session `web.db` (SQLite) recording every HTTPS connection attempt for auditing
- Guest-side `capsem-net-proxy` binary: TCP-to-vsock relay for transparent HTTPS proxying
- Default developer allow-list: GitHub, npm, PyPI, crates.io, Debian repos, elie.net
- AI provider domain blocking at SNI level (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, googleapis.com)
- `net_events` Tauri command for querying recent network events from the frontend
- Per-VM network isolation: each VM gets its own policy, web.db, and connection handlers

### Changed
- SNI proxy replaced by MITM transparent proxy for full HTTP-level traffic inspection and policy enforcement
- HTTPS proxy connections spawn as async tokio tasks instead of blocking threads
- Control protocol split into disjoint `HostToGuest`/`GuestToHost` enums with reserved variants for file operations and lifecycle management
- Guest agent boot sequence restructured: vsock connects first, receives clock + env from host before forking bash
- Max control frame size bumped from 4KB to 8KB to accommodate env var payloads
- `just build`, `just repack`, and `just check` now run tests with coverage as a gate before proceeding
- Kernel now includes IP stack + netfilter (CONFIG_INET=y, iptables REDIRECT) for air-gapped networking
- Rootfs includes iproute2, iptables, and dnsmasq for guest network setup
- capsem-init sets up dummy0 NIC, fake DNS, and iptables rules at boot
- `just repack` now includes `capsem-net-proxy` alongside `capsem-pty-agent`
- Refactored VM smoke test into pytest-based diagnostic suite (`capsem-doctor`)
- Split tests into focused modules: sandbox security, utilities, runtimes, AI CLIs, workflows
- Added sandbox security tests (rootfs read-only, no kernel modules, no /dev/mem, network isolation, no setuid/setgid)
- Added Python and Node.js execution tests (actual code runs, not just version checks)
- Added AI CLI sandbox verification (binaries execute without crashing)
- Network sandbox tests updated: verify air-gapped proxy (allowed/denied domains) instead of raw network block

### Fixed
- MITM proxy TLS handshake failure: rustls crypto provider was not initialized, causing silent panics on every proxy connection
- MITM proxy now uses explicit `builder_with_provider()` instead of relying on global crypto state, eliminating the class of bug entirely
- `just build` failure: Dockerfile.rootfs could not find CA cert (build context was `images/`, cert was in `config/`)
- `just build` failure: certifi not installed when CA bundle patching step runs
- Kernel `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=n` was silently ignored because the option requires `CONFIG_EXPERT=y` to be configurable
- Kernel cmdline now includes `ro` for read-only rootfs mount
- `just smoke-test` now returns non-zero exit code on test failures
- In-VM diagnostic test fixes: `/proc/modules` absent is valid (CONFIG_MODULES=n), bash test checks availability not current shell, CA bundle tests grep base64 instead of DER-encoded CN, Python TLS test verifies handshake not HTTP status

### Deprecated
- `sni_proxy::handle_connection` -- use `mitm_proxy::handle_connection` for full HTTP inspection

### Security
- `CONFIG_EXPERT=y` in kernel defconfig ensures all hardening options (KALLSYMS=n, MODULES=n, etc.) are respected by `make olddefconfig`
- Kernel symbol table (`/proc/kallsyms`) now empty -- eliminates kernel ASLR bypass vector
- MITM proxy enables full HTTP audit trail: every request method, path, status code, and headers are logged to web.db
- HTTP-level policy rules allow fine-grained control (e.g., allow GET but deny POST to specific paths)
- Default-deny domain policy: only explicitly allowed domains are reachable from the guest
- No DNS leaves the VM: all resolution is faked to a local IP
- Corporate policy (`/etc/capsem/corp.toml`) overrides user settings for enterprise lockdown
- Per-VM isolation prevents cross-VM network interference

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- PTY-over-vsock terminal communication replacing serial broadcast channel
- Guest PTY agent (`capsem-pty-agent`) for high-throughput terminal I/O with full PTY support
- Terminal resize support (`stty size` reflects window dimensions)
- vsock control channel with MessagePack framing for structured commands (resize, heartbeat)
- Kernel vsock support (`CONFIG_VSOCKETS`, `CONFIG_VIRTIO_VSOCKETS`)
- Multi-VM-ready app state architecture (`vm_id`-keyed `HashMap`)
- Output coalescing (10ms/64KB) to prevent frontend IPC saturation
- Boot-time command execution via vsock (`Exec`/`ExecDone` control messages)
- CLI mode (`capsem "command"`) routes commands through vsock PTY agent with exit code propagation

### Changed
- Terminal input now routes through vsock when connected, falling back to serial
- Guest init script (`capsem-init`) launches PTY agent instead of direct bash/setsid
- CLI mode rewritten from serial I/O to vsock-based execution with proper exit codes
- `just repack` now cross-compiles and bundles the PTY agent into the initrd for fast iteration
- Serial forwarding stops once vsock connects, eliminating duplicate output
- M5 redesigned: zero-trust network boundaries with SNI proxy domain filtering, AI provider domain blocking, and real-time file telemetry via fanotify
- M6 redesigned: active AI audit gateway with 9-stage event lifecycle (PII scrubbing, tool call interception, secret scanning), replaces passive proxy approach
- M7 redesigned: hybrid MCP architecture -- local tools run sandboxed in-VM, remote tools route through host gateway with credential injection
- M8 redesigned: per-session audit databases with zstd-compressed blobs, OverlayFS config write-back, enterprise observability (Prometheus, OTLP, corporate policy via MDM)

### Fixed
- Shell prompt not appearing after command execution (stderr was redirected to /dev/hvc0, sending readline prompt through buffered serial path instead of vsock PTY)

### Security
- Removed serial console fallback: missing PTY agent halts boot instead of opening an unprotected shell
- Replaced scattered `unsafe { File::from_raw_fd }` + `mem::forget` with centralized `borrow_fd` helper using `ManuallyDrop`
- Added T13 threat (AI Traffic Audit Bypass) documenting the enforcement chain: iptables -> vsock bridge -> SNI proxy -> audit gateway
- Updated T3 (Data Exfiltration) with fswatch telemetry, PII engine, and secret scanning mitigations
- Updated T5 (Credential Theft) with gateway key injection and PII scrubbing on model calls
- Updated T11 (Network Exfiltration) with AI domain blocking at SNI proxy and 9-stage lifecycle enforcement
