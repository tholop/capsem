"""The modules `just test` is made of, and the ones provable from source.

`_test-candidate-run` was 366 lines because six modules each re-solved the same
problems inside one `bash` body, selected by a `CAPSEM_TEST_MODULE` environment
variable and a `module_enabled` function. A module was a region of a file
between two `if` statements, which is why running one in isolation meant
setting an environment variable and hoping, and why nothing could say what one
would do without doing it.

Each is a command now. It declares the workspace it needs and the graph of
steps it contains, and both are answerable for free.

`vmmodules` holds the three that cannot start against a bare checkout, because
they need built artifacts or a VM. The seam is what a module needs before it
can begin.
