"""The functional suites drive every SDK, so the functional module prepares them.

The Braavos suite builds and runs the Python, TypeScript and Rust SDKs against a
real gateway. The suites run inside the kernel sandbox with no network, and the
test itself was installing what it needed: `uv run` built the Python SDK in an
isolated environment that fetched hatchling from PyPI, `node tools/build.mjs`
found no `node_modules`, and `cargo run` compiled the SDK inside a 60-second
budget. All three failed in a focused functional run and passed only on a
checkout an earlier phase had happened to warm.
