//! One serialization boundary for policy mutations and reloads.
//!
//! A policy edit is load, modify, save, active-policy materialization and VM
//! acknowledgement. Each step had its own short lock, so two edits could
//! interleave between them: B loaded before A saved and wrote A's rule away,
//! or B re-materialized a session while A was waiting for that VM's
//! acknowledgement (google/capsem#202). Every route that edits policy or
//! reloads it holds one `PolicyMutation` for the whole sequence; the functions
//! that record or push a mutation take it as an argument, so an unserialized
//! call does not compile.
